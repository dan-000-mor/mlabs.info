id=&#8221;1070&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p>With all GM longitudinal transmissions, it is far and away easiest to identify them by the amount of bolts on the transmission pan. \u00a0Only the TH350 and TH400 share the same number of bolts. \u00a0So if you count the bolts and get <strong>17<\/strong> you can be sure that you have <strong>identified the 4L80E transmission. \u00a0<\/strong>The 6L80E, which is the successor to the 4L80E, has 20 bolts.<\/p>\n<p>If you are looking at a transmission and you don&#8217;t even really know where to start, you can look at whether or not it has any sort of computer control to it. \u00a0At this point you see that it is computer controlled, you&#8217;ll find a circular wiring harness connector. \u00a0You&#8217;ve now eliminated all of the classic <a
