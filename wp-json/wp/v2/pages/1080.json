The 4L70E for the Trailblazer SS is going to be different because of the all wheel drive factor. \u00a0The torque converter is the same for both transmissions, but the output shaft will need to swap it out with the 4L60E or 4L65E version if you are direct replacing one of these transmissions. \u00a0Another option would always be to have a new driveshaft made (or your old one modified) to accept this new output shaft.<\/p>\n<p>As far as whether or not the ECM can even talk to the 4L70E, it&#8217;s a non issue as long as the PCM is a 1996 or newer model. \u00a0And since any GM vehicle made in 1996 would have had the old school SBC or the LT1, a 4L70E will not be a direct fit for them anyway. \u00a0<strong>The internal wiring harnesses are different<\/strong>. \u00a0There is also an input speed sensor that keeps track of the transmission speed at the input shaft. \u00a0This will not stop you from swapping. \u00a0You can leave it unplugged and the transmission will function just fine in a vehicle that never had a provision for this.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on the year of your transmission and the PCM that is controlling it, you&#8217;ll very well may need to re pin your wiring harness. \u00a0This post is a great place to start. \u00a0It&#8217;s from HP tuners and they lay out the differences in the wiring harnesses. \u00a0You&#8217;ll need to lookup exactly what the pin layout is on your particular vehicle before swapping them if you are thinking of pursuing this avenue.<\/p>\n<p><a

the takeaway<\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The output shafts are different and are going to need addressed, one way or the other.<\/li>\n<li>4L70E uses the same converter as its

identification section of these pages. \u00a0The first is how to tell if the transmission that they are looking at that is not attached to a car is what they think it is. \u00a0The other one is that you&#8217;re looking at a vehicle and you want to make sure that they transmission in it is the one that you want before you spend all of your time and money on pulling it. \u00a0Both of these scenarios are covered directly below.<\/p>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<h4>Scenario 1: \u00a0You are looking at a transmission outside of a car and want to know if you&#8217;ve found a 4L70E.<\/h4>\n<p>The 4L60\/65\/70E all share an identical case and number of pan bolts. \u00a0So if you happen to know that you are looking at one of them, but don&#8217;t know which one, here&#8217;s the easiest way to distinguish them.<\/p>\n<p>The absolute easiest way to identify if it&#8217;s a 4L70E is the harness connector. \u00a0The outer part of it is going to be black or neon blue. \u00a0Below is a pic of the harness connector on the 4L60E. \u00a0Here is a link to a post that has a pic of a <a href=\"https:\/\/ls1tech.com\/forums\/automatic-transmission\/1405115-how-spot-4l70e-pics.html\">black 4L70E connector<\/a>. \u00a0The connector is on the passenger side on the flat part of the transmission right where it meets the pan on top. \u00a0Next time I come across one I&#8217;ll update this page to include it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1085\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1085\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a
