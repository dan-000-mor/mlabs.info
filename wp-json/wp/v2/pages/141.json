transmission. \u00a0It was intended for use in base model and stripped down models. \u00a0This\u00a0version\u00a0was similar to the original Powerglide introduced for the 1950 model year. \u00a0It lacked the vacuum control and required the driver to manually shift the transmission themselves.<\/p>\n<p>By the time that production eventually ceased, the Powerglide was being phased out by the 3 speed Turbo-Hydramatic 350 and Turbo 400. \u00a0 1973 was the final year that it was an option from the factory.<\/p>\n<p>Although the Powerglide has been out of \u00a0production\u00a0for over 4 decades, there is still a healthy aftermarket demand for them. \u00a0This is due its bulletproof reputation in the racing community. \u00a0It was effectively replaced by the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/turbo-hydramatic-350\">TH350<\/a>\u00a0for passenger cars.<\/p>\n<h2>Gearing<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>First gear- 1.74<\/li>\n<li>Second gear-1.00 (direct)<\/li>\n<li>Reverse- 1.76<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Powerglide Identification<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_100\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100\" style=\"width: 146px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/powerglide-pan-gasket.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-100\" src=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/powerglide-pan-gasket.jpg\" alt=\"Powerglide Pan gasket\" width=\"156\" height=\"118\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-100\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Powerglide has 14 bolts<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>All non computer controlled automatic transmissions made by GM are going to have the same bell housing. \u00a0The easiest way to identify\u00a0a Powerglide would be by the bolt pattern on the pan gasket.<\/p>\n<p>It is worth noting that until 1963 it was only produced with cast iron. \u00a0These transmissions are heavier and only found in the cars they were produced in. \u00a0They are not a desirable core (unless you are doing a numbers matching restoration) and are generally not offered as a re-manufactured option.<\/p>\n<p>The Powerglide came with both the 16 and 27 spline output shafts. \u00a0They are the same length as the TH-350, which lends itself well to a very simple swap. \u00a0In it\u2019s most common form it is 27\u2033 Long with a rear mount 19.5\u2033 from the bellhousing.<\/p>\n<h2>Racing<\/h2>\n<p>The aluminum Powerglide has had a long life in the world of drag racing, monster truck racing, and any application where an extremely reliable and simple transmission is favored. \u00a0Also, due to its relative simplicity there is little torque loss between the flywheel and the rear wheels.<\/p>\n<p>Drag racers love it because it only shifts once, and in a quarter-mile that is really all that is needed. \u00a0It is also relatively cheap and inexpensive to repair. \u00a0That along with its reputation for being bulletproof has cemented its legacy in the racing world.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>History The Powerglide transmission is the first mainstream automatic transmission developed by GM for the Chevrolet line of motor vehicles. \u00a0It was released for the 1950 model year.
