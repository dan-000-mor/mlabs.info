Cable just like the 700R4. \u00a0Sometimes it is referred to as the detent cable. \u00a0The TV cable serves as a combination of kick down cable and throttle position sensor. \u00a0Adjusting the TV cable is a relatively simple process. \u00a0It involves pressing a half-moon looking button that changes the geometry between the transmission and throttle blade. \u00a0Here is a <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/parts\/2004r-700r4\/tv-cable\/\">great write-up on the TV cable<\/a> and adjusting it. \u00a0It is very old and simple but tells you exactly what you need to know regarding adjustment and how exactly it works.<\/p>\n<p>Many people have complained about the reliability of the 200-4R. \u00a0These transmissions will wear out before they otherwise would if the cable is not properly adjusted. \u00a0If you are swapping into a vehicle that was not originally equipped with the 200-4R, make sure that your detent cable matches your throttle bracket, which should also match your carburetor or fuel injection.<\/p>\n<p>Adjusting the TV Cable can be quite the challenge. \u00a0Here is a good resource on how to perform that adjustment. \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.tciauto.com\/media\/custom\/upload\/700R4-2004R_TVCableAdj.pdf\">http:\/\/www.tciauto.com\/media\/custom\/upload\/700R4-2004R_TVCableAdj.pdf<\/a><\/p>\n<p>[the_ad id=&#8221;1070&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h2>200-4R Gear Ratios<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>First: 2.74<\/li>\n<li>Second: \u00a01.57<\/li>\n<li>Third: \u00a01.00<\/li>\n<li>Fourth(Overdrive): \u00a00.67<\/li>\n<li>Reverse: \u00a02.07<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>200-4R Identification<\/h2>\n<p>The <strong>200-4R uses a 16 bolt pan<\/strong>. \u00a0If you are able to count the pan bolts, it is far and away the easiest way to identify it. \u00a0At this point you should be confident that you are looking at either a 700R4 or a 200-4R. \u00a0The pans look wildly different and will make identification a snap from here. \u00a0The 200-4R pan gets smaller toward the end, whereas the 700R4 is almost a perfect square. \u00a0Owing to the fact that they have very similar dimensions, the 200-4R is often mistaken for the TH350. \u00a0Be aware that the TH350 has 13 bolts, and a more square transmission pan. \u00a0You&#8217;ll also notice the TV Cable coming from it. \u00a0The TH350 has a modulator to the right of the tail shaft if you are looking at it from the back.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>Frequently asked questions about 200-4R<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What is the fluid capacity?<\/strong> \u00a0The total fluid capacity of the 200-4R is 11 quarts. Roughly 4 of them are going to be the fluid that you put into the converter. \u00a0Certainly there can be some minor differences between applications. \u00a0Some transmission come with high-capacity pans. \u00a0Some have had an aftermarket transmission cooler installed. \u00a0That can be good for an extra quart unto itself. \u00a0The good news is that is why there is a dipstick, so just make sure you aren&#8217;t over capacity.<\/li>\n<li><strong>What are the differences between\u00a0the 200-4R and 700R4? \u00a0<\/strong>There are as many differences as there are similarities between these two transmissions. \u00a0They both were released in the early 80&#8217;s as an answer to publics desire for cars with better fuel economy. \u00a0They do not have the same gearing. \u00a0The 2.74 first gear in the 200-4R is much closer to the TH350(2.52) than the 700R4(3.06). \u00a0The TH350 and 200-4R share both the same length of 27 11\/16&#8243; and width at the bellhousing of 19 1\/8&#8243;. \u00a0They both also share the same 27 spline output shaft as well. \u00a0This makes the 200-4R nearly a bolt in replacement of the TH350 and certainly takes less effort than the 700R4 does to swap in. \u00a0The overdrive gear on the 200-4R is also more aggressive(.67 vs .70), which allows the engine to turn 3% slower down the highway.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Is the 200-4R computer controlled?<\/strong> \u00a0No, it is not.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Can I use my old speedometer cable? \u00a0<\/strong>The 200-4R utilized a mechanical speedometer for its entire production run. \u00a0So, you should have no issue using it with an old mechanical speedometer. \u00a0Just be aware that you may need to change the gearing on the speedometer cable in order to get the speedometer to read properly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The 200-4R is a transmission that was manufactured by General Motors for the 1981 model year. \u00a0It is a the lesser known of the two overdrive transmissions made by GM in 1980&#8217;s, and is still considered part of the Turbo-Hydramatic series. \u00a0The 200-4R is very similar to the 700R4, although there are some differences between &#8230; <a title=\"200-4R Identification and Specs\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/2004r\/\" aria-label=\"More on 200-4R Identification and Specs\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":74,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"full-width-page.php","meta":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/218"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=218"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/218\/revisions"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/74"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=218"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
