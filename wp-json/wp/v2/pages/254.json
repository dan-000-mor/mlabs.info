automatic transmission that GM ever produced, you&#8217;d be hard pressed to find one that is larger than the turbo 400. \u00a0It is just huge. \u00a0If it was lined up with a<a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/2004r\/\"> 200-4R<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/turbo-hydramatic-350\/th350-transmission-identification\/\">TH350<\/a>, or 4L60E it would be easy\u00a0to identify a TH400. \u00a0It would be far and away\u00a0the largest transmission there.<\/p>\n<p>Since it&#8217;s not very likely that you are going to run into a lineup of automatic transmissions being the biggest isn&#8217;t going to be very helpful.<\/p>\n<p>There are 13 bolts on the pan underneath the transmission. \u00a0If you count 13 you are almost home free, but the Th350 also has 13. \u00a0Since these are the two most common GM automatic \u00a0transmissions of the latter half of the last century it&#8217;s very important that you figure out which is which.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>TH400 uses an electronic kick-down mechanism<\/strong>, which means that there will be an electric plug on it. \u00a0The TH350 uses a mechanical linkage that attaches to the carburetor. \u00a0Th350 has the vacuum modulator in the back, and the <strong>TH400 keeps it on the side<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Using the pan bolt pattern<\/strong> is the easiest way to identify the TH400. \u00a0Both the TH350 and TH400 have\u00a0a similar look. \u00a0They utilize a\u00a0kick down cable, and they both use the same bellhousing bolt pattern. \u00a0Identifying the Th400 is really as easy as knowing the differences between it and the TH350.<\/p>\n<p>Also,\u00a0<strong>take a look at the bolt pattern itself<\/strong>. \u00a0The Th400 has a much more complex pan then the Th350. \u00a0The Th350 is basically a square with a corner taken out of it. \u00a0See for yourself. \u00a0The TH400 on the other hand has <strong>9 different angles<\/strong> on the the pan. \u00a0It&#8217;s one of the more complex pans that GM made.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_383\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-383\" style=\"width: 186px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a

shift too early. \u00a0This is almost always cause by the\u00a0<b>vacuum line<\/b>\u00a0that runs to the modulator from the intake manifold. \u00a0While they came from the factory with hard lines, many people will swap them out for soft lines when doing a swap, since finding a hard line for the particular vehicle can be an issue.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Late shift<\/span>&#8211; \u00a0The Th400 will often shift a little later than a person would like, espescially at the track. \u00a0This is usually caused by its\u00a0<b>electric kick-down switch<\/b>.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000080;\">General not shifting right<\/span>&#8211; \u00a0If you\u2019ve checked that the kick down circuit is ok, and the vacuum line is too, than it may be time to look at the vacuum modulator itself. \u00a0It\u2019s\u00a0<b>more likely to have fluid in it<\/b>\u00a0than it is to have gone out itself.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>TH400\u00a0and Non-GM vechicles<\/h2>\n<p>Maybe the best compliment comes from your competition. \u00a0And at least a dozen auto makers have paid GM to use the TH400 instead of creating a competitor for it. \u00a0These include Toyota, Ferrari, Rolls-Royce, and Hummer. \u00a0This is a true testament to its bulletproof reliability and ease of tuning.<\/p>\n<p>The Turbo 400 has been used in Jeeps from the factory. \u00a0Early model AMC Jeeps used an adapter plate to mate it with the GM bellhousing bolt pattern. \u00a0Later, a specific TH400 was made just for Jeep. \u00a0This version tilted the transmission about 4 degrees in order to better accommodate the transfer case. \u00a0It has not been produced for quite a while and is considered pretty rare. \u00a0The Turbo 400 is compatible with most Jeeps. \u00a0However, the CJ5 has to narrow of a wheelbase to accommodate it. \u00a0The specialty jeep TH400 case is 24 1\/2 inches long.<\/p>\n<p>When looking at a Jeep that came from the factory with the Turbo 400, it&#8217;ll be bolted to either the\u00a0BW 13-39 or the Dana 20 transfer case. \u00a0In the 1960&#8217;s some Jeeps came with Buick engines, so they used neither an adapter nor the Jeep specific transfer case. \u00a0Some of the AMC specific adapters on these transmissions have been prone to failure.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The TH400 is an aluminum cased three speed automatic transmission that was produced\u00a0by GM. \u00a0It was introduced
