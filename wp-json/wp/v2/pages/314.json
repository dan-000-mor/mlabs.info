Mlabs Info's purpose in\n        collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand\n        how Mlabs Info's visitors use its website. From time to\n        time, Mlabs Info may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by\n        publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.<\/p>\n    <p>Mlabs Info also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol\n        (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on 700r4transmissionhq.com        blogs\/sites. Mlabs Info only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same\n        circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that\n        commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog\/site\n        where the comment was left.<\/p>\n    <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information<\/h3>\n    <p>Certain visitors to Mlabs Info's websites choose to interact\n        with Mlabs Info in ways that require Mlabs Info to gather\n        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Mlabs Info gathers\n        depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at <a\n                href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\">700r4transmissionhq.com<\/a> to provide a\n        username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Mlabs Info are asked to\n        provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to\n        process those transactions. In each case, Mlabs Info collects such information only insofar as\n        is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with\n\t\tMlabs Info. Mlabs Info does not disclose personally-identifying information\n        other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with\n        the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.<\/p>\n    <h3>Aggregated Statistics<\/h3>\n    <p>Mlabs Info may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its\n        websites.

Some\n        of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by\n        using Mlabs Info's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to\n        them. Mlabs Info will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and\n        personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated\n        organizations, as described above, Mlabs Info discloses potentially personally-identifying and\n        personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or\n        when Mlabs Info believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the\n        property or rights of Mlabs Info, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered\n        user of an Mlabs Info website and have supplied your email address, Mlabs Info        may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to\n        date with what's going on with Mlabs Info and our products.
