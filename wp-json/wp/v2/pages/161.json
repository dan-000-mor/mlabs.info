\u00a0The engineers thought of it as a three speed Powerglide and the similarities are certainly there. \u00a0Most people when they rebuild a muscle car or their original Powerglide fail will switch to this transmission since most common versions of it will bolt in as a direct replacement to\u00a0it. \u00a0It was engineered for the entire GM line, and not just the Chevrolet division. \u00a0It was phased out of the from passenger vehicles in the 1984 model year, and from trucks and vans by 1986.<\/p>\n<h2>THM350 vs THM400<\/h2>\n<p>The Turbo 350 was built for lighter duty applications than it&#8217;s heavier duty counterpart. \u00a0The THM400 was designed to handle more torque and horsepower, therefore it is still the preferred transmission of people looking for a factory automatic that can handle a lot of power. \u00a0There is a tradeoff for all that torque capacity though, the THM400 is noticeably heavier than the THM350 and has more of a drop in power through the clutches and gears. \u00a0In the aftermarket there are a lot of transmission builders like TCI and Monster transmission that sell a THM350 with all of the weak points fixed that will hang with any Turbo 400. \u00a0The THM400 is also longer, so if you are going to swap it into your car, you&#8217;ll probably have to have the driveshaft shortened.<\/p>\n<h2>Identifying a Turbo 350<\/h2>\n<figure

obvious which one is which. \u00a0Unfortunately, that is rarely the situation. \u00a0The good news is that there are only two THM transmissions with a 13 bolt pan. \u00a0The THM400 is the other one and it is noticeably larger. \u00a0\u00a0While they both do have 13 bolts, the Turbo 350 has a much simpler pan. \u00a0Just take a look at the pan. \u00a0If you have 13 bolts and 5 different corners, you can feel confident that you are looking at the Turbo 350 and not the 400.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_166\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-166\" style=\"width: 277px\" class=\"wp-caption
