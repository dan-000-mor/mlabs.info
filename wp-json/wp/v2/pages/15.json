If you have a clear view of the transmission count the bolts.&nbsp; Did you count 16?&nbsp; If you did you have found a 700R4 or a 4L60.&nbsp; Remember, 4L60 was just another moniker for GM\u2019s popular overdrive.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You want to make sure that you don\u2019t have a 4L60E on your hands though.&nbsp; &nbsp;In most cases if someone has told you that you are looking at a 700R4 and you count 16 bolts you can be reasonably sure that you have found what you were looking for.&nbsp; But to be sure check to see if the long \u201cTV-Cable\u201d is attached to the Transmission.&nbsp; If there is none look at the tail shaft.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If the speedometer cable is mechanical than you have a 700R4.&nbsp; If it has wiring coming from it you are looking at a 4L60E. &nbsp;Sometimes when people don&#8217;t really know what they are looking for, they will search for MD8 transmission. &nbsp;MD8 is stamped on the passenger side of most 700R4 cases.<\/p>\n<h2>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<h2>700R4 Identification- With the Identification Tag:<\/h2>\n<p>Lets say that you have found a transmission at a swap meet, on Craigslist, or at the salvage yard.&nbsp; Many people want to know exactly what year the transmission came from, and what vehicle it was in.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The first digit<\/strong> of the Identification Tag will be the model number.&nbsp; <strong>It is not intuitive.<\/strong>&nbsp; The first units were for the 1982 model year.&nbsp; So you would expect the first model year ID number to be either 2(for 82) or 1, right?&nbsp; It\u2019s not.&nbsp; It starts with a 9 and then jumps to 3.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_58\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58\" style=\"width: 595px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/pic2.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-58\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-58 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/pic2-1024x615.png\" alt=\"700R4 Identification Plate Location\" width=\"605\" height=\"363\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/pic2-1024x615.png 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/pic2-300x180.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/pic2-150x90.png 150w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/pic2.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-58\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">You&#8217;ll find the plate right at #1 on the image.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The&nbsp;model years are as follows:<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Year Manufactured:<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0=1990<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1=1991<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2=1992<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3=1983<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4=1984<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5=1985<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6=1986<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7=1987<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8=1988<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9=1989 or 1982<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The second group of digits<\/strong> is the Model indicator. &nbsp;It&#8217;s two letters.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">After the model the next area<\/span> of the tag is the transmission type. &nbsp;It is one letter. &nbsp;In this case <strong>M is letter code for 700R4. &nbsp;82-85 are missing this entirely. &nbsp;<\/strong>Try using the method above to figure it out.<\/li>\n<li>The fourth area&nbsp;is the plant that the transmission was manufactured in. &nbsp;It is one letter.<\/li>\n<li>The fifth line in the code&nbsp;is the serial number of the transmission. &nbsp;If the serial number is ground off it&#8217;s likely that it was rebuilt by GM at some point.<\/li>\n<li>The sixth line is the date of manufacture.<\/li>\n<li>The seventh line is the shift in which the 700R4 was built.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>K Case<\/h2>\n<p>There was a 700R4 with a thicker case built for 4&#215;4 trucks. &nbsp;It is known as the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/700r4-4x4\/\">&#8220;K case&#8221;<\/a> version because of the rather large K stamped on the bellhousing area. &nbsp;This is certainly the easiest way to identify it. &nbsp;
