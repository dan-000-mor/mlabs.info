If your Chevy Uplander\u2019s horn isn\u2019t working, there are a few potential causes. We\u2019ll cover each of them, starting with the easiest and most likely issues and working from there. A test light can make diagnosing a horn that isn\u2019t working much easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The horn is typically located behind the front grill on the Chevy Uplander and is usually pretty easy to change if necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/chevy-uplander.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"656\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/chevy-uplander-1024x656.jpg\" alt=\"chevy uplander Shaking Wheel\" class=\"wp-image-272259\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/chevy-uplander-1024x656.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/chevy-uplander-300x192.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/chevy-uplander-768x492.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/chevy-uplander-1536x985.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/chevy-uplander.jpg 1616w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n<h2><strong>1. Fuse Blown<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Test-Washer-Fuse-scaled.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"550\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Test-Washer-Fuse-1024x550.jpg\" alt=\"Horn Not Working Fuse Test Chevy Uplander\" class=\"wp-image-288854\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Test-Washer-Fuse-1024x550.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Test-Washer-Fuse-300x161.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Test-Washer-Fuse-768x413.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Test-Washer-Fuse-1536x825.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Test-Washer-Fuse-2048x1100.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A blown fuse is often the reason why your Uplander\u2019s horn stops working and should be the first thing you check (unless the <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/chevy-uplander-airbag-light-on\/\" title=\"\">airbag light is on<\/a>). If it is, go down to section 3.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Uplander\u2019s horn fuse could be located in the engine compartment or under the dash. A sticker inside the fuse box should tell what each fuse does on the backside of its door. You can also check your van\u2019s manual for a schematic of the fuse locations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Testing the Fuse<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy to test your Uplander\u2019s horn fuse. If you have access to a test light, you don\u2019t need to pull the fuse at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clamp the test light onto a good ground source (metal that\u2019s not painted that bolts to the body, chassis, engine block, or negative battery terminal).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your test light is grounded, test the Uplander\u2019s horn fuse by touching both electrical contacts. If only one of them is hot, then the fuse has failed. If they both light up the test light, the fuse is OK.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can pull the fuse and look at the element that connects the two fuse blades. If it\u2019s broken, the fuse is blown. You\u2019ll need to determine what caused the horn fuse to fail in the first place. Otherwise your Uplander\u2019s horn will stop working again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>2. Horn Wiring Harness<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Horn-Button.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"628\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Horn-Button-1024x628.jpg\" alt=\"Horn Stopped Working Causes Chevy Uplander\" class=\"wp-image-291972\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Horn-Button-1024x628.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Horn-Button-300x184.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Horn-Button-768x471.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Horn-Button-1536x943.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Horn-Button.jpg 1848w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the horn\u2019s wiring harness. It\u2019s another quick thing you can check when your Chevy Uplander has a broken horn. It\u2019ll be tucked in behind the grill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it connected to the horn all the way? Follow it and look for any burned, damaged, or scarred wiring. Repair as needed and see if the horn works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>3. Broken Clock Spring<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Clock-Spring.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Clock-Spring-1024x889.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-291971\" width=\"341\" height=\"295\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Clock-Spring-1024x889.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Clock-Spring-300x260.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Clock-Spring-768x667.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Clock-Spring-1536x1333.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Clock-Spring.jpg 1790w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A clock spring allows the steering wheel to rotate without turning the wiring harness inside the steering wheel.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a modern vehicle like the Chevy Uplander, the clock spring supports a minimum of two systems (the airbag and the horn). If your van has steering wheel controls, the inputs for those go through the clockspring as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Testing the Clock Spring<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to test your Uplander\u2019s clock spring. You can turn the wheel back and forth and observe what happens, or you can use an OBD II scanner (if the airbag light is on).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Turn the Wheel<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Push the horn button and turn the steering wheel while you continuously press the horn. If the horn works at different angles or the airbag light goes on and off, that indicates that the clock spring has gone bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Use a Code Reader<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s highly likely that your Chevy Uplander\u2019s airbag light will also be on when the clock spring is bad. You can use an OBDII code reader to determine what is causing it to come on. It should confirm that the clock spring has failed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>4. Faulty Horn Relay<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The horn button sends power through the clock spring, down the harness, and to the horn relay. The horn relay will be located under your Uplander\u2019s hood in the relay box. It might be under the dash (not usually the case). The video below shows how to test the horn relay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Horn Relay Testing and Replacement\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/4n-mQS3-XaU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>5. Horn Failure<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s quite possible that your Chevy Uplander\u2019s horn has failed. It has likely failed if it has a solid ground connection and power at the harness connection. You can test it using a jump wire from the battery straight into the power.
