But, these are the most common symptoms of P0500 in general.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Speedometer Failure<\/strong>&#8211;  Without a properly working vehicles speed sensor, the speedometer will not register any speed.  It&#8217;ll just sit at 0 MPH while you are driving.  The <strong>Odometer<\/strong> may not work at all.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cruise Control Failure<\/strong>&#8211;  When a vehicle is not getting a signal from the VSS, it&#8217;ll not let the cruise control engage.  This makes sense since it can&#8217;t control the speed when it doesn&#8217;t know how fast it is going.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Harsh Shifts-<\/strong>  The transmission may shift differently than it normally does.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Anti-Lock Brakes<\/strong>&#8211; The Insight&#8217;s ABS may not work or could be compromised.  The VSS is one component of a complicated set of sensors that keeps the wheels from locking under heavy break pressure.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>P0500 Causes: Honda Insight<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Honda-Insight.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Honda-Insight-300x140.png\" alt=\"P0500 Honda Insight\" width=\"300\" height=\"140\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-24803\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Honda-Insight-300x140.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Honda-Insight.png 312w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bad VSS<\/strong>&#8211;  More often than not, when P0500 is thrown, replacing the Vehicle Speed Sensor will remedy the problem.

When this is the case, the Insight will no longer be able to determine what the VSS is reading.  If you can safely take a look at the harness, that would be a great place to start.   Make sure that it is plugged in all of the way.  From there, check and see if any of the wiring is frayed.

It is possible that the ECM\/PCM has gone bad.  That is the last place to look, not the first.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the location of the VSS, the wiring harness leading to them can often fail. So, replacing it without inspecting it can be a mistake.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>P0500 Fix<\/h2>\n<p>It would be best to start with inspecting the Wiring Harness first.

If it doesn&#8217;t, replacing the sensor could fix the problem.  If it does, you&#8217;ll have to test the rest of the circuit.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Diagnosing P0500 in the Honda Insight can be challenging.
