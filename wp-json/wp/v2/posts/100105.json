Some vehicles are equipped with a manual airbag switch for the passenger seat that can be turned on and off with the key.&nbsp; Most have a sensor under the front seat that weighs the occupant.&nbsp; If they aren\u2019t heavy enough, the passenger airbag will not deploy in a collision.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Clock Spring<\/strong>&#8211; The clock spring is a coil inside the steering wheel that connects the electrical components of the steering wheel to the rest of the vehicle (including the airbag).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Airbag<\/strong>&#8211; Your car\u2019s airbag is released by a chemical explosion.&nbsp; It can inflate the bag in 30ms.&nbsp; Here\u2019s a detailed video on how an airbag system <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qCIes_xJdGo\">works<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sensors-<\/strong>&nbsp; Your 300&#8217;s airbag module takes data from the wheel speed sensors, brake pressure sensor, seat pressure sensors, seat buckle sensors,&nbsp;gyroscopes, and a sensor that tries to detect if you\u2019re in a crash (often referred to as the MEMS sensor).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>How it Uses These Components<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The airbag control module will use the data from the sensors listed above to deploy the airbags when necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Airbag Light Diagnosis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"Airbag Light Fix\" class=\"wp-image-190153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The airbag light comes on because your Chrysler 300\u2019s airbag control module has failed a self-diagnostic cycle, which means there will be codes stored that\u2019ll tell you why the light came on.&nbsp;

Here are some common reasons your 300&#8217;s airbag light could come on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1.&nbsp; Seat Belts<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Belt-Buckle-Vehicle.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Belt-Buckle-Vehicle.jpg\" alt=\"Airbag Light most common fixes\" class=\"wp-image-300062\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Belt-Buckle-Vehicle.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Belt-Buckle-Vehicle-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Safety belts are still the most critical safety feature in the event your 300 crashes.&nbsp; Modern vehicles have sensors running to the seat belts to let the computer system know if they are buckled and locked up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a seat belt stuck in the lock position, it might be why your airbag light is on.&nbsp; See if you can tug at it and get it moving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With your 300&#8217;s engine running and in park, sit in each seat and buckle the belt. If one of the sensors doesn&#8217;t tell you that a seat belt has been unbuckled when you get up, that&#8217;s likely your culprit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2.&nbsp; Seat Sensors<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Seat-Belt-Sensor.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Seat-Belt-Sensor.jpg\" alt=\"Chrysler 300 Airbag Light Causes\" class=\"wp-image-300063\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Seat-Belt-Sensor.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Seat-Belt-Sensor-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The wiring harness under the front seats shorting out is perhaps the most common reason the airbag light comes on. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the seatbelt light doesn&#8217;t come on when someone isn&#8217;t wearing a belt in the front, it&#8217;s either the wiring harness under the seat or the seatbelt sensor that is at fault.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The seat sensors tell the airbag system that the seat is occupied.&nbsp; Some older vehicles have a manual button to turn the passenger airbag on or off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look under the seats to see if you can find any part of the wiring harness that has come dislodged or damaged.&nbsp; This is a very common reason why the airbag light comes on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Clock Spring<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Clock-Spring.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Clock-Spring-1024x889.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-291971\" width=\"256\" height=\"222\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Clock-Spring-1024x889.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Clock-Spring-300x260.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Clock-Spring-768x667.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Clock-Spring-1536x1333.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Clock-Spring.jpg 1790w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A typical clock spring<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The clock spring connects your 300&#8217;s steering wheel controls, horn, and airbag to the rest of the car.
