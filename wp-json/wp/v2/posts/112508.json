Toyota Rav4<\/h2>\n<p>There are a few ways that your Rav4 will tell you that your thermostat is bad.&nbsp; Hopefully you&#8217;ve caught them before any damage was done.&nbsp; Thermostats are very <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=thermostat+Toyota+Rav4&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=4bdcccf825f43de6d112cbb72e8524c0&amp;language=en_US\">inexpensive<\/a>, f you do end up needing one.&nbsp; Here are the most common signs of a bad thermostat.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Overheating<\/h3>\n<p>The most common symptom of a bad thermostat is overheating.&nbsp; The thermostat doesn&#8217;t open up.&nbsp; This keeps the coolant from entering the engine.&nbsp; When this happens, the coolant in the radiator stays relatively cool, and the engine overheats fast.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Blown Head Gasket<\/h3>\n<p>If your Rav4 runs too long without coolant circulating through the engine, the head gasket can blow.&nbsp; Signs of a <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Rav4-blown-head-gasket\/\">bad head gasket<\/a> include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>rough idle<\/li>\n<li>bad fuel mileage<\/li>\n<li>water in the oil<\/li>\n<li>a lot of white smoke from the exhaust<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A head gasket is a very costly and time consuming repair.&nbsp; Hopefully you&#8217;ve caught your bad thermostat before this has happened.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_112473\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-112473\" style=\"width: 194px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Bad-Thermostat-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-112473\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Bad-Thermostat-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"Toyota Rav4 Bad Thermostat Diagnosis\" width=\"204\" height=\"221\"><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-112473\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A typical thermostat<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>No Heat<\/h3>\n<p>If your Rav4 has no heat at all, it is entirely possible that the thermostat is stuck open.&nbsp; When this happens, coolant constantly cycles through the engine.&nbsp; On very cold days, this cooling capacity is not needed, and the engine never warms up.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s more on <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Rav4-no-heat\/\">no heat<\/a> diagnosis if this is what you are experiencing.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Warning Light or Temp Gauge Spiked<\/h3>\n<p>The first sign of a bad head gasket that most people are going to notice is a warning light or spiked temperature gauge.&nbsp; If you&#8217;ve noticed this, you need to get off of the road and get your Rav4&#8217;s engine shut down as soon as possible, before any lasting damage can occur.<\/p>\n<p>A bad thermostat can cause the temp gauge or warning lights to come on.&nbsp; But, it&#8217;s not the only reason.&nbsp; Other things that can cause the temp gauge to spike are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Low Coolant- If your Rav4 has been losing coolant, it&#8217;s possible that you&#8217;ve finally leaked out enough that the cooling system can no longer do its job.<\/li>\n<li>Bad Radiator- If the radiator has been clogged enough that coolant can no longer pass through efficiently, your Rav4 will overheat.<\/li>\n<li>Water Pump-&nbsp; The water pump is responsible for pushing coolant through the radiator and the engine.&nbsp; When it goes bad, water can&#8217;t circulate through the cooling system, even if the thermostat is open.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Coolant Leak Around the Thermostat<\/h3>\n<p>As pressure builds around a bad thermostat that is stuck shut, you&#8217;ll notice that there may be coolant leaking around the thermostat housing.&nbsp; This leak is not the cause, but rather a symptom of your Rav4&#8217;s bad thermostat.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion:&nbsp; Rav4 Bad Thermostat Symptoms<\/h2>\n<p>Replacing a thermostat is a relatively affordable repair.&nbsp; If you have reason to believe it&#8217;s gone bad, ignoring it will only end up costing a lot more money in the long run.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Good luck diagnosing your Toyota Rav4.&nbsp; If there is anything that you would like to add, please leave a comment below.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
