The majority of the time, it&#8217;s going to be a problem with the alignment.&nbsp; Although, we recommend checking the tire pressure first.&nbsp; If the tire pressure has been off for a long enough period of time, the tires will wear in the center or the edges.&nbsp; There&#8217;s more on that below.<\/p>\n<h3>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<h3>Alignment Issues<\/h3>\n<p>The alignment of your Kia Amanti&#8217;s tires is set to balance these two factors:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tire Wear<\/li>\n<li>Handling<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>When your vehicle leaves the factory, the engineers who designed it have the alignment set to be the best possible combination of tire wear and handling.&nbsp; As your Amanti&#8217;s suspension deals with everyday abuse, the wheels can be thrown out of alignment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When this happens, your Amanti&#8217;s tires will not wear evenly.&nbsp; Handling usually suffers as well.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Camber Angle<\/h4>\n<p>The camber angle is how straight up and down your tires are.&nbsp; If they were completely up and down, the tire would make its best contact with the road whenever you are going straight.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not when tires need to make their best contact.<\/p>\n<p>Tires need to make their best contact with the road&nbsp;<strong>while cornering<\/strong>.&nbsp; This is where camber angle comes in.&nbsp; Camber makes sure that this occurs by always leaving the tires angled slightly for cornering.<\/p>\n<p>When you have too much camber, one side of the tire wears faster than the other, since that side is in contact with the road.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Uneven-Tire-Wear-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-110946\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Uneven-Tire-Wear-Diagnosis.png\" alt=\"Kia Amanti Uneven Tire Wear Causes\" width=\"200\" height=\"292\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>&nbsp;<\/h4>\n<h4>Toe<\/h4>\n<p>When your Kia Amanti leave the factory, its toe settings are adjusted for the best performance and longevity.&nbsp; The toe angle is the degrees in that your Amanti&#8217;s tires face each other, or the degrees out in which they face out from one another.<\/p>\n<p>When the toe angle is off, only the very edge of the tire usually wears out.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s a good diagram that shows what toe angle is.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Tire-Not-Wearing-Even.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-110947\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Tire-Not-Wearing-Even.png\" alt=\"Amanti Tire Not Wearing Even\" width=\"200\" height=\"273\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Overinflated Tires<\/h3>\n<p>If your tires are <strong>worn in the center<\/strong>, but the tread looks pretty good on the sides, that&#8217;s a classic case of overinflated tires.&nbsp; On the inside of your Amanti&#8217;s driver side door there should be a sticker.&nbsp; &nbsp;That sticker will have the proper tire inflation amounts for your exact year and model.&nbsp; Make sure that is the level that you inflate the tires too.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Under-inflated Tires<\/h3>\n<p>When your Amanti&#8217;s tires are <strong>worn on the edges<\/strong>, that indicates that the tires are under-inflated.&nbsp; Just like with the over inflated tires, look at the door panel, get the proper PSI number for your exact vehicle, and air them up accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Suspension Problems<\/h3>\n<p>If your Amanti&#8217;s suspension components are worn out, it can cause some strange tire wear patterns.&nbsp; It can cause a condition known as <strong>cupping<\/strong>.&nbsp; If you were to look at your tires, they would have diagonal wear marks in them.&nbsp; This is a serious issue, and you should bring it in to a mechanic right away.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Good luck seeing what&#8217;s causing your Amanti&#8217;s tires to wear unevenly.&nbsp; If the pressure looks good, go ahead and bring it in to an alignment shop to have them take a look at it.&nbsp; If there is anything you would like to add, please leave a comment below.&nbsp; Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
