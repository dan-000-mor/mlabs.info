Here we are going to discuss what it actually feels like in your vehicle. \u00a0Before diagnosing any transmission issue, you&#8217;ll want to drive to let the engine warm up to its normal operating temperature. \u00a0This will ensure that the transmission is shifting as it would nearly all the time that it normally operates.<\/p>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve let the transmission warm up turn the radio off and roll the windows up. \u00a0You&#8217;re going to want to pay maximum attention to what&#8217;s going on with both the engine and transmission. \u00a0Pay particular attention to any\u00a0shuddering and vibration as you accelerate. \u00a0Shuddering and vibration are in no way a guarantee that something is wrong with the torque converter. \u00a0I&#8217;ve outlined a few examples of other things that could be wrong if there is a vibration below.<\/p>\n<p>A common issue that happens with front wheel drive cars is that the axle shafts (or cv shafts) go bad. \u00a0This can create a similar vibration, but it will get worse or only exist when you go around corners. \u00a0Below are signs that will tell you if the torque converter is damaged or going out:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/transmission-slipping\/\">Slipping Transmission<\/a>\u00a0at low speed- \u00a0The torque converter &#8220;stall speed&#8221; is the speed that the engine needs to be turning before the torque converter will begin engaging the transmission. \u00a0When a torque converter is malfunctioning it can cause this stall speed to change and feel like the transmission is slipping. \u00a0If you suspect this is happening with your car, has your fuel mileage changed? \u00a0This iso fen a sign that the transmission isn&#8217;t operating efficiently.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Slipping at highway speed<\/span>&#8211; \u00a0Nearly all modern automatic transmissions have what is called a locking converter. \u00a0This type of \u00a0torque converter has been the standard since the mid eighties, and is universally used today. \u00a0What it does is have \u00a0clutches in it that let the transmission make a physical connection with the engine. \u00a0This eliminates all operating inefficiency when it is at high speed (usually after about 45 miles an hour). \u00a0This increases the fuel mileage achieved and brings an automatic transmissions efficiency more in line with a standard transmission.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Chattering or vibration<\/span>&#8211; \u00a0If you feel a vibration going down the road it could very well be the torque converter. \u00a0The fluid level may not be where it needs to be. \u00a0Have you ever had an uneven load in the washer? \u00a0It spins around and the washer sounds like it is beating itself to death. \u00a0The torque converter is the same way when it can&#8217;t spin the right amount of fluid through itself. \u00a0It is way less likely, but the bolts that hold the torque converter to the flex plate can come loose and cause a vibration at speed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Repair the Converter ASAP<\/h2>\n<p>A torque converter has the potential to keep on going for months after it first starts to go out. \u00a0But, when it does, it&#8217;ll blow out and toast the transmission. \u00a0It&#8217;ll rain debris and metal destroying it almost instantly. \u00a0Don&#8217;t put it off. \u00a0If you aren&#8217;t sure, take it to a garage and have it looked after. \u00a0Putting it off is going to cost you big money and is dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Cost to Replace a Torque Converter<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you are positive that you have a bad torque converter, than replacing it is a must. \u00a0Torque converter replacement cost is going to depend a lot on what type of vehicle you are driving. \u00a0In general, a front wheel drive vehicle is going to be more expensive from a labor point of view and could cost anywhere between $300-$1000 depending on the vehicle.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Tourque-Converter-Problems-and-Solutions.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-864\" src=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Tourque-Converter-Problems-and-Solutions.jpg\" alt=\"Torque Converter Problems\" width=\"617\" height=\"517\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Tourque-Converter-Problems-and-Solutions.jpg 940w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Tourque-Converter-Problems-and-Solutions-300x251.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Tourque-Converter-Problems-and-Solutions-768x644.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Tourque-Converter-Problems-and-Solutions-100x84.jpg 100w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Tourque-Converter-Problems-and-Solutions-150x126.jpg 150w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Tourque-Converter-Problems-and-Solutions-200x168.jpg 200w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Tourque-Converter-Problems-and-Solutions-450x377.jpg 450w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Tourque-Converter-Problems-and-Solutions-600x503.jpg 600w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Tourque-Converter-Problems-and-Solutions-900x754.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you are going to attempt to replace the problematic torque converter yourself, than you certainly are going to be saving yourself tons of money. \u00a0If the vehicle that you are attempting to fix is front wheel drive, than it&#8217;ll be more difficult to do than a rear wheel drive. \u00a0This is due to the transmission location. \u00a099% of the battle is just getting to the converter. \u00a0After that it&#8217;s a pretty simple fix. \u00a0Just a few bolts, slide the converter off of the input shaft, and tighten it back down. \u00a0If you&#8217;ve never done this before try and start at the beginning of the weekend to give yourself plenty of time and you can save yourself a ton of money.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The torque converter is responsible for converting the energy generated by the engine at the flywheel and transferring it to an automatic transmission. \u00a0It functions in the same place in the driveline as a clutch would, creating a bridge between the engine and the transmission. \u00a0When they go bad, they have the potential to leave &#8230;
