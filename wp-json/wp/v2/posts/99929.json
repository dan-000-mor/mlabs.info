the system to protect you in the event of an accident. &nbsp;If all parts of this system are not working properly, it can cause the airbag light to come on.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been in an accident, the airbag light is going to stay on until the system has been restored. &nbsp;It will not work until repaired.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some common reasons that your 9-3&#8217;s airbag light could come on.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>1. &nbsp;Seat Belts<\/h3>\n<p>Safety belts are still the most important safety feature in the event your 9-3 crashes. &nbsp;Modern vehicles have sensors running to them to let the computer system know if they are buckled, and if they are locked up.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a seat belt that is stuck in the lock position, it might be the reason why your airbag light is on. &nbsp;See if you can tug at it and get it moving again.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. &nbsp;Seat Sensors<\/h3>\n<p>The seat sensors tell the airbag system that the seat is occupied. &nbsp;Some older model vehicles have a manual button to turn the passenger airbag on or off.<\/p>\n<p>Look under the seats to see if you can find any part of the wiring harness that has come dislodged or damaged. &nbsp;This is a very common reason why the airbag light comes on.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. &nbsp;Airbag Itself<\/h3>\n<p>If the 9-3&#8217;s airbag system is not getting a response from one of the airbags itself in the diagnostic cycle, it&#8217;ll turn the airbag light on until the problem has been fixed, and the system has been reset.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Airbag-Light-On-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-99618 size-full\"

ECU\/Sensors<\/h3>\n<p>The airbag system control unit may have gone bad. &nbsp;If this is the case, you can have it replaced or send for a new one. &nbsp;This often happens whenever you get into a fender bender that doesn&#8217;t deploy the airbag. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One or more of the crash sensors may have been triggered, but not enough to deploy the airbag. &nbsp;The airbag sensors can also fail and throw the airbag light on if there is water damage. &nbsp;This is one of the reasons why it is not wise to buy a car with flood damage, even if it looks like it is otherwise fine.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>5. &nbsp;Not Reset After Deployment<\/h3>\n<p>If your vehicles airbag has gone off and been replaced, the airbag system needs reset. &nbsp;It won&#8217;t just work until the airbag system has been reset by a shop, or you send the module to someone who can do it for you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Is it Safe to Drive Your 9-3 with the Airbag Light On?<\/h2>\n<p>It is not <strong>as safe<\/strong> to drive with the airbag light on. &nbsp;The airbag system has saved countless lives since its invention. &nbsp;If you do drive with your 9-3&#8217;s airbag light on, you are relying solely on the safety belts to keep you safe, which is not as safe.<\/p>\n<p>All of the technology that keeps you from crashing is still there (if equipped), such as the traction control, anti-lock brake system, and blind spot detection. &nbsp;But if you get in an accident, the technology that could save your life is going to be 30+ years out of date.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Saab 9-3 Airbag Light On<\/h2>\n<p>Your Saab 9-3&#8217;s airbag system is complicated. &nbsp;There can be a lot of different reasons why the airbag light may have come on. &nbsp;Most of them should be left to a professional. Just because the vehicle can be driven, does not mean that the problem should be ignored. &nbsp;If there is anything that you would like to add, please leave a comment below. &nbsp;Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every time you start your Saab 9-3, the computer system runs a self diagnostic check on all major systems. &nbsp;If any of these checks fail, you will see a diagnostic warning light on the dash for the corresponding system. &nbsp;When the airbag system fails this check, you&#8217;ll see the airbag light.
