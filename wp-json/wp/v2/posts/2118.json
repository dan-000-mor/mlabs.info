When they go bad they cause all sorts of problems. \u00a0If one of them has a delay in engagement, it can the transmission to buck and jerk until the solenoid can engage all of the way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Clutch Packs<\/strong>&#8211; It&#8217;s more likely that when a clutch pack wears out it will slip, and not grab and jerk. \u00a0But, if they have been exposed to excessive heat in them it can cause them to wear unevenly. \u00a0When this is the case they can cause the vehicle to chatter and jerk in-between shifts.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts on a Jerking Between Shifts<\/h2>\n<p>The ideas listed above apply to transmission related issues. \u00a0Keep in mind though that shifting causes a change in RPM. \u00a0When a vehicle has ignition problems they typically manifest themselves at lower RPM under heavier loads.<\/p>\n<p>It may be worth your time to make sure that you don&#8217;t have an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.autotap.com\/techlibrary\/diagnosing_battery_charging_iginition_system.asp\">ignition problem<\/a>, such as a bad coil pack before servicing your transmission. \u00a0If you are convinced your transmission is at fault, get it in before it fails you entirely. \u00a0Good luck!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the most annoying things that can happen to a vehicle is when it jerks shifting gears. \u00a0There are a few things that can cause the problem. \u00a0They aren&#8217;t necessarily related to the transmission itself. \u00a0One of the side effects of a car jerking is motor mount or crossmember damage. \u00a0You&#8217;ll want to fix &#8230; <a title=\"Car Jerks When Shifting Gears Automatic Transmission\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/car-jerks-when-shifting-gears-automatic-transmission\/\" aria-label=\"More on Car Jerks When Shifting Gears Automatic Transmission\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3,1],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2118"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2118"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2118\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2118"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2118"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2118"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
