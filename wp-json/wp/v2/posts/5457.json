\/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>P0401 Causes<\/h2>\n<p>Diagnosing what is causing the P0401 code is typically not very tricky.\u00a0 Here are the most common causes of P0401:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blocked EGR Tube<\/strong>&#8211;\u00a0 The tube that carries the exhaust gases back to the motor may clog up over time.\u00a0 Alternatively, it can become bent or kinked.\u00a0 This is especially true if you are experiencing P0401 right after doing some engine work.\u00a0 Check the tube and see if it is cracked, clogged or otherwise damaged.<\/li>\n<li><strong>EGR Valve Itself is Bad<\/strong>&#8211;\u00a0 The EGR valve itself is usually not going to be the place to start.\u00a0 But, they certainly are the cause of P0401 often enough.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Vacuum Issues<\/strong>&#8211;\u00a0 The EGR valve relies on engine vacuum to operate.\u00a0 So, if you are encountering P0401 and other codes, the P0401 may be a symptom of larger problems.\u00a0 For instance, if the motor is not running well enough to create sufficient vacuum to operate the EGR valve, than P0401 will often be thrown.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sensor Issue<\/strong>&#8211;\u00a0 The Differential Pressure Feedback- EGR sensor can go faulty and cause the EGR valve to stop operating properly and throw the code.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ud60NZuma-A\" width=\"560\"

and it is usually pretty easy to get the problem, since it is right on top of the engine.\u00a0 Most folks see P0401 Insufficient EGR flow, look up the price of an EGR valve, see how cheap it is and just throw a new one on.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s often a mistake.\u00a0 That&#8217;s because the EGR valve is not going to be the culprit most of the time.\u00a0 Here are some of the most common fixes to help clear the P0401:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the Tube- \u00a0It&#8217;s a good idea to check the tube going to the EGR because it&#8217;s often the cause of P0401, easy to do, fast, and replacing it is very affordable. \u00a0If it&#8217;s cracked, you&#8217;ll need to get a new one. \u00a0If it&#8217;s clogged you can get away with cleaning it and replacing it.<\/li>\n<li>Check DPFE Sensor Voltage- \u00a0If you are good with a voltage meter go ahead and test it. \u00a0Here&#8217;s a good article on how to do that from\u00a0<em>It Still Runs<\/em>: \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/itstillruns.com\/test-dpfe-sensor-7964100.html\">How to Test DPFE Sensor<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Test the EGR Valve- \u00a0A vacuum\u00a0 gauge will help you determine if the EGR valve itself has gone bad. \u00a0Here&#8217;s an article from\u00a0<a

challenging aspect is the DPFE sensor. \u00a0If you aren&#8217;t sure you can tackle that, you can always test everything else first. \u00a0By process of elimination, you can be relatively confident that the DPFE is at fault. \u00a0If there is anything you would like to add about P0401, please feel free to add a comment below. \u00a0Good
