But, they are not that difficult to locate.&nbsp; The catalytic converter itself is a part of the exhaust system.&nbsp; Tracing it, you&#8217;ll find it somewhere between the tail pipe and intake manifolds.<\/p>\n<p>They almost always have a heat shield around them and an oxygen sensor somewhere before them. &nbsp;It is necessary for the catalytic converter to be <strong>before the muffler<\/strong>. &nbsp;The muffler is really the only thing that you can confuse for the catalytic converter on your Chevy Spark.<\/p>\n<p>The catalytic converter may be bolted or welded on depending on the year and make of the vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"price\">Catalytic Converter Price: &nbsp;Chevy Spark<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_69964\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69964\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-69964\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Catalytic-Converter-Cost.jpg\" alt=\"Chevy Spark Catalytic Converter Price\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Catalytic-Converter-Cost.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Catalytic-Converter-Cost-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-69964\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A typical catalytic converter is going to be more that $100 dollars<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The catalytic converter for your Sparks cost will vary by model year and engine size. &nbsp;But, as a rule catalytic converters are not cheap. &nbsp;They are one of the most stolen items on a vehicle there is. &nbsp;They are almost always <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=Chevy+Spark+catalytic+converter&amp;crid=X0DN4QK8F58A&amp;sprefix=Chevy+Spark+cat,aps,167&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_8_17&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=8364580813255b23b9c27fa6a6f7117c&amp;language=en_US\">more than $100<\/a>, and can cost several hundred dollars for a large on that sits behind a V8.<\/p>\n<p>Since it often requires welding to replace the catalytic converter, it&#8217;ll often mean a trip to the exhaust shop. &nbsp;Later model vehicles can cost over $1000, when it&#8217;s all said and done.<\/p>\n<p>Catalytic converters also have a have a scrap value of up to $250, with the average being closer to $90. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s the <a href=\"https:\/\/catalyticcontrol.rockawayrecycling.com\/catalytic-converter-scrap-prices\/\">source<\/a> on that, if you&#8217;d like to check the going rates in the scrap market.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"symptoms\">Chevy Spark: &nbsp;Bad Catalytic Converter Symptoms<\/h2>\n<p>It is not uncommon for the catalytic converter to fail, as the years and mileage take their toll. &nbsp;They will fail faster if there is an issue with misfiring or a bad air\/fuel mixture.<\/p>\n<p>When your Spark has a major engine problem, the <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Chevy-Spark-flashing-check-engine-light\/\">check engine light will begin flashing<\/a>. &nbsp;In most cases, this flashing condition occurs to help try and save the catalytic converter.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the symptoms of a bad catalytic converter have to do with the lack of exhaust flow through the Cat. &nbsp;Once it gets so clogged, your Spark will be barely drivable.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the most common signs of a bad catalytic converter in a Chevy Spark:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>MPG Suffers<\/strong>&#8211;
