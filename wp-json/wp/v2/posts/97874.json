There are other situations as well.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll cover those for you below.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Battery Draining While Sitting<\/h2>\n<p>If your vehicle is running fine when you park it, and it won&#8217;t start, there could be a few problems causing this to happen.&nbsp; Most of the time, it&#8217;s the battery itself causing this problem.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Battery-Draining.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-97875\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Battery-Draining.jpg\" alt=\"Car Battery Draining\" width=\"423\" height=\"331\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Bad Battery<\/h3>\n<p>When battery drains when parked, the odds are that it&#8217;s the battery itself.&nbsp; If the battery light came on while you were driving, but before you parked, it could be the alternator.&nbsp; If you didn&#8217;t see a battery light, and now the car is dead when you go to start it, the first thing that you need to look at is the battery.<\/p>\n<p>You can take it up to the local parts store and have it tested.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll need to charge it for a while, so plan on dropping it off and returning a few hours later.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll tell you if it holds a charge or not.&nbsp; If it passes the test, it&#8217;s time to move on to the battery cables.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Battery Cables<\/h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ll want to take a look at the battery posts where they bolt to the battery.&nbsp; If there is a lot of corrosion here, you&#8217;re going to want to clean that off with a wire brush.&nbsp; There are also specific battery post cleaners that you can buy.&nbsp; They are usually less than 10 bucks at the local parts store or Wal-Mart.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Alternator<\/h3>\n<p>It is possible that the alternator wasn&#8217;t charging the battery enough when the vehicle was running and left the battery drained.&nbsp; Most parts stores can test an alternator for you.&nbsp; They usually don&#8217;t charge anything.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Battery Draining While Parked<\/h3>\n<p>If your battery is draining after being parked for a few days, here are two possible scenarios.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The battery itself has gone bad and just can&#8217;t hold a charge long enough to be of any use after the vehicle sits, and it drains.<\/li>\n<li>Something is drawing power when it shouldn&#8217;t be.&nbsp; If this is the case, the first thing that you are going to want to look at is all of the lights.&nbsp; If your car is equipped with a glove compartment light, check and see if it is turning off.&nbsp; Maybe one of the map lights is on in the back?&nbsp; How about all of the accessory plugs?&nbsp; Is something plugged into one of them and drawing power?&nbsp; If not, it may be that there is an electrical problem.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a pretty good video on exactly how to track down a &#8220;parasitic draw&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How to Fix Battery Drain in Your Car (Parasitic Draw Test)\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/B__DqK90IIc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

If it is you should see the battery or alternator light on, it indicates that the alternator is not creating the necessary voltage to charge the battery.<\/p>\n<p>It could be a bad battery, or more likely a bad battery cable too.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s not very likely.&nbsp; If you hear a whining noise accompanied by the battery light, it&#8217;s almost guaranteed that it&#8217;s the alternator that is at fault.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion:&nbsp;
