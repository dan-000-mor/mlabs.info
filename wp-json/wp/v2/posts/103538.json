&nbsp;If your Encore&#8217;s timing chain or belt has fallen off completely, broken, or has <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/timing-chain-jumped-symptoms-and-diagnosis\/\">jumped a few teeth<\/a>, it is entirely possible that the engine won&#8217;t even start. &nbsp;You might hear it slapping around as the engine cranks over. &nbsp;If this is the case, the damage is already done.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Noise<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;A good indication that a timing belt has gone bad is going to be noise. &nbsp;There may be a sound of rubber beating against something. &nbsp;It\u2019ll typically be a rough rattling sound, and it is often most noticeable right when you start up your Encore.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Performance Decrease<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;If the timing belt has jumped a few teeth, but hasn&#8217;t fallen or broken off yet, it can knock the engine out of time. &nbsp;The timing belt is responsible for keeping the camshaft(s) in sync with the crankshaft. &nbsp;If the timing belt has moved, that means that the valves will open and close at the wrong time. &nbsp;This will lead to a performance decrease. &nbsp;It&#8217;s highly likely that the engine is going to be misfiring as well.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Loss of Fuel Mileage<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;Fuel mileage will suffer when the engine is no longer kept in time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Glazing and&nbsp;Dry-rot&nbsp;(Timing Belt Only)<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;If you are looking at the Encore&#8217;s&nbsp;timing belt itself, check to see if the belt is glossy. &nbsp;It should grip your finger as you lightly brush across it. &nbsp;If it is slippery and dry, that is a great indication it could be bad as well.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Check Engine Light<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;If the timing chain or belt needs replaced due to wear, but hasn&#8217;t jumped a tooth, the service engine soon light will not come on. &nbsp;But, if it has jumped, the check engine light will very likely come on. &nbsp;At the least, you should get some sort of misfire relate codes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_103435\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103435\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Bad-Timing-Belt.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-103435 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Bad-Timing-Belt.png\" alt=\"Buick Encore Bad Timing Belt Symptoms\" width=\"420\" height=\"708\"><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-103435\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A typical timing belt<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t Overlook the Tensioner<\/h2>\n<p>The timing tensioner can also go bad. &nbsp;The tensioners job is to keep the right amount of pressure on your Buick Encore&#8217;s timing belt or chain. &nbsp;As the belt\/chain stretches through normal operation, it would get loose and fall off or jump. &nbsp;The tensioner keeps this from happening by keeping a consistent amount of force on the belt. &nbsp;So, as the belt stretches it adjusts for this stretching. &nbsp;If the tensioner is no longer keeping enough pressure on the timing belt, it&#8217;ll cause it to fail.<\/p>\n<p>If you are going to replace the tensioner, make sure to swap the belt as well. &nbsp;It&#8217;s so hard to get to, and timing belts\/chains are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=Buick+Encore+timing+belt&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=2befd612e6c2f15c6aa5f2bc60fcf194&amp;language=en_US\">relatively affordable<\/a>. &nbsp;It&#8217;s just the TIME that it would take you or your mechanic to get to it that&#8217;s the problem.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Buick Encore Timing Chain Symptoms<\/h2>\n<p>Most manufacturers will recommend changing the timing belt at 60k or 100k miles. &nbsp;There isn&#8217;t usually a service window at all for the chains. &nbsp;Although, it can vary. &nbsp;Where a lot of people get into trouble is when they buy a used car with 100k no realizing that the belt service is going to be immediately due.<\/p>\n<p>Good luck with your Encore. &nbsp;If there is anything that you would like to add, please leave a comment below. &nbsp;We would appreciate it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
