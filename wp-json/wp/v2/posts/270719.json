Dead batteries and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/topics\/engineering\/keyless-entry-system\">non-programmed key<\/a> we can work with and fix relatively quickly, assuming that is the issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a quick look at those three potential issues and the solutions and steps to resolve the invalid key ID on a Nissan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dead Batteries<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Key-Fob-Batteries.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Key-Fob-Batteries.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-270721\" width=\"291\" height=\"193\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Key-Fob-Batteries.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Key-Fob-Batteries-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Key-Fob-Batteries-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Remembering to change the batteries in a car key fob is hard. It is even hard to remember at times that they use a battery. It is the first step to resolving this issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, a key fob on the standard Nissan models that experience this issue will allow pressing and sliding the back of the fob, exposing the battery. Be careful with the fob and the battery during the removal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nissan uses the standard circular battery known as the <strong>CR2032 Li-Mn 3V<\/strong> for most of its vehicles. These batteries are standard in many other makes and models of key fobs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A flat head screwdriver will likely be needed to pop the battery out easily without damaging the fob. A butter knife would get the battery out of the fob as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do not hit the fob against anything like a countertop or the ground to get the battery to come loose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, gently pry the battery out. Most CR2032 batteries can be found locally at places such as AutoZone, Advance Auto Parts, Napa Auto Parts, or even a local battery shop that specializes in selling batteries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new pack of these batteries will typically cost less than $5.00. Some even require the purchase of a pack instead of a single battery during the purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the old dead battery out of the fob, swap it with a new one, and try the key fob and see if it is functioning correctly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bad Key Fob<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Nissan-Fob.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Nissan-Fob.jpg\" alt=\"Repair Damaged Nissan Key Fob\" class=\"wp-image-270722\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Nissan-Fob.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Nissan-Fob-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Nissan-Fob-768x494.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If the battery replacement did not work, unfortunately, there is a chance that the key fob is faulty. It is harder to recognize because physical damage is not always present when a faulty key fob decides it has started the vehicle for the last time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could be damage created by water and one point, or it could be a key fob that went faulty. If this is the case and testing and re-programming the key fob did not work, the local Nissan dealer will be able to get a new replacement fob to fix the issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Programmed Incorrectly<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How To Program A 1998 - 2020 Nissan Frontier Remote Key Fob  - Keyless Entry - DIY Video Tutorial\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/W3utESXyH0Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the other most common issues with the Nissan Key fobs displaying incorrect key ID is something as simple as reprogramming the key to the vehicle. It is easy to test and fix (assuming the fob has no damage, and the key fob has new batteries).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to approach the key-fob reprogramming steps is to follow the user manual that came with the vehicle. It will typically have a series of instructions (straightforward and elementary) that can be taken to re-sync the key to your vehicle (so to speak) and get the key fob working correctly.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a video above that works for MOST Nissan vehicles, but consulting the manual is a smart first move.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Takeaway<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a car not functioning correctly or starting when needed can be a hassle. Unfortunately, if none of the following solutions seemed to solve the issue, calling the dealer is likely the next best step.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s nice not needing to physically insert a key into the steering column anymore with the way cars have evolved and adapted with technology over the years.
