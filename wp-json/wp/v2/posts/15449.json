Take a look around and see if you can find the vacuum leak. Here&#8217;s a great YouTube video on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9CPqbaSgcok\">how to find a vacuum leak<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Oxygen Sensor<\/strong>&#8211; The P0172 codes is thrown when the oxygen sensor(s) do not register the right amount of oxygen in the exhaust. When the oxygen sensor is bad, it can cause a false reading and trigger the code. The computer will still adjust the air\/fuel mixture to compensate. This will cause the Grand Prix to run rich.  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=aps&amp;field-keywords=Pontiac+Grand Prix+oxygen+sensor&amp;sprefix=Pontiac+Grand Prix+oxygen+,aps,236&amp;crid=3VCM4UFOAF66L&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=0d733522de6e1a41ae85d9ca973a3530&amp;language=en_US\">Pontiac Grand Prix O2 Sensor<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Mass Air Flow Sensor<\/strong>&#8211; The mass air flow sensor calculates the volume of air entering the engine. If it has gone bad, the air fuel mixture will be off and the P0172 code will show.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bad Fuel Injectors<\/strong>&#8211; If you have one or more fuel injectors that have gone bad that can certainly cause the air\/fuel mixture to go bad.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fuel Pump\/Fuel Filter<\/strong>&#8211; Today&#8217;s modern fuel injected motors need a lot of fuel pressure to atomize the gas properly. If the <strong>fuel pressure<\/strong> is off, atomization doesn&#8217;t happen properly and the optimal air\/fuel mixture isn&#8217;t achieved.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Air Filter<\/strong>&#8211; While it&#8217;s not the most common reason to throw the P0172 code, a clogged air filter certainly can cause the code to throw.
