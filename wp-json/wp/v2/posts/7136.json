In the Land Cruiser, OBDII P0420 is often caused by a bad oxygen sensor, but there can be other causes as well.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most common trouble codes with all Toyota vehicles is the P0420. This code number references a number that is given to you when you plug your Toyota Land Cruiser into a OBDII scanner.

Here are the most common ones.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Oxygen Sensor<\/strong>&#8211; The P0420 codes is thrown when the oxygen sensors on both sides of the exhaust have very similar readings. When the oxygen sensor is bad, it can cause a false reading and trigger the code. If the engine does not exhibit any of the decreased performance associated with a bad catalytic converter, it very well may be the oxygen sensor (if you haven&#8217;t noticed the performance loss yet).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Catalytic Converter<\/strong>&#8211; A catalytic converter is responsible for scrubbing out as much pollution as possible from the Land Cruiser\u2019s exhaust. Over time, they can become clogged. Although, modern catalytic converters are supposed to last the life of most vehicles, it could be there is some underlying problem if it has clogged.<\/li>\n<li><strong>O2 Sensor<\/strong> <strong>Wiring<\/strong>&#8211; Over time, the oxygen sensor wiring can go bad. It is especially volatile since it is right next to the hot exhaust at all times. The downstream oxygen sensor wiring is especially volatile since it is so far from the ECM (more distance to travel.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Land Cruiser Timing<\/strong>&#8211; If your Land Cruiser is misfiring or the exhaust timing is off, this can affect the gasses that are actually going to the O2 sensors enough to cause the P0420 code to register.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Exhaust<\/strong> <strong>Leak<\/strong>&#8211; If there&#8217;s a noticeable exhaust leak coming from the vehicle it can change what the O2 sensors register enough to throw the P0420 code.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Engine Temp Sensor<\/strong>&#8211; If the computer doesn&#8217;t know what the engine temp is it&#8217;ll keep the fuel mixture rich. When the fuel mixture is rich, the exhaust the O2 sensors see will be out of range and it could throw the sensor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Toyota Land Cruiser P0420 Code Possible Solutions<\/h2>\n<p>Often, the oxygen sensor is the cause of P0420. Specifically it&#8217;ll usually be the O2 sensor(s) on the upstream side of the catalytic converter.<\/p>\n<p>But, don&#8217;t be surprised if it&#8217;s not. It would be a good idea to check the exhaust for leaks first. You should be able to hear an exhaust leak easily underneath of the vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you have an exhaust leak, you&#8217;ll probably need to test the O2 sensors and\/or catalytic converters. Here are a couple of good guides to help with that.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NKsS6AELPuM\">How to Test an Oxygen or O2 Sensor<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kNXh1Lphzr4\">Test your Catalytic Converter in 15 Minutes!!<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Good luck figuring out what is causing P0420 with your Toyota Land Cruiser.
