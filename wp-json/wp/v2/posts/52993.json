While it can be tempting to throw a new camshaft position sensor in and see if it fixes the problem, the CPS doesn&#8217;t always end up fixing clearing the code. It can often end up being a wiring problem that causes P0341 in your SL. It&#8217;s worth doing the due diligence to see what&#8217;s causing the code.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>P0341 Symptoms: Saturn SL<\/h2>\n<p>The CPS helps an engine determine optimal timing for combustion. When it is not functioning properly, it can cause a lot of drivability problems in your SL, if it&#8217;ll even run at all.<\/p>\n<p>As stated directly above, often the vehicle won&#8217;t even start.  If it does it&#8217;ll often be in a failsafe mode with the following symptoms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Failure to Start<\/li>\n<li>Poor Idle Quality<\/li>\n<li>Decreased Fuel Economy<\/li>\n<li>Drop in Engine Power<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Saturn SL P0341 Causes<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Saturn-SL.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Saturn-SL-300x121.png\" alt=\"P0341 Saturn SL\" width=\"300\" height=\"121\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-49087\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Saturn-SL-300x121.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Saturn-SL.png 321w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>P0341 code is often caused by a failure in the Camshaft Position Sensor itself, or the wiring. Here are the most common causes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wiring Issue<\/strong>&#8211; The Camshaft Position Sensor wiring is exposed to harsher conditions than a lot of the wiring in your SL. It is worth looking at it to see if it has developed a <strong>short<\/strong>, or to see if the <strong>harness connector<\/strong> is loose or damaged. Here&#8217;s a great article on how to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thoughtco.com\/car-electrical-how-to-find-a-short-circuit-4156483\">diagnose a short in a car<\/a>. It&#8217;s really not complicated once you get the hang of it.  Also, if the wiring harness has been moved closer to the spark plug wires, they can cause interference as well.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Camshaft Position Sensor Failure<\/strong>&#8211; After examining all of the wiring around the CPS, it&#8217;s going to be time to test the sensor itself. Here is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RvuzZJqQDf4\">fantastic video<\/a> on how to do that with a <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2JNxlKX\">multimeter<\/a>.   If you need a camshaft position sensor, they are pretty <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=aps&amp;field-keywords=camshaft+position+sensor+Saturn+SL&amp;rh=i:aps,k:camshaft+position+sensor+Saturn+SL&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=fe4263da4ecf8cce546b3437209928a8&amp;language=en_US\">reasonable on Amazon<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are significantly less likely causes for P0341 as well, such as the PCM failing. You&#8217;ll need to check the voltage at the camshaft sensor to see if it is within spec, and that the reluctor wheel is ok.<\/p>\n<p>A great place to start is to see if the harness is plugged in tightly at the PCM and at the CPS itself.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>P0341 is a serious concern and should be addressed as soon as possible. We recommend taking your SL into a mechanic (if it&#8217;ll move at all). If you have any suggestions for improving this article, please feel free to leave a comment below.
