Bad Ignition System<\/h2>\n<p>Your ignition system is more than just the spark plugs.&nbsp; It relies on data from the crank and cam sensors to time the spark properly.&nbsp; The coil or coil packs need to be strong.&nbsp; The spark plugs themselves can go bad over time.&nbsp; Although with a modern vehicle, it should be able to go near &#8211; 100,000 miles without the plugs showing much damage.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Diagnosis + Repair<\/h3>\n<p>If you do have a problem with the ignition system, you&#8217;ll more than likely get a diagnostic trouble code that indicates that there is a problem with the ignition system, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0300-Chevy-S10\/\">P0300<\/a> (Random Multiple Misfire) or P030X where X represents the exact cylinder that is misfiring.<\/p>\n<p>If there is reason to believe that the ignition system has gone bad, take a look at the spark plugs first.&nbsp; They can tell you a lot about what is going on with the engine.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s a more in depth guide on <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-spark-plug-symptoms-Chevy-S10\/\">bad spark plugs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_117141\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-117141\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Backfire-Causes.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-117141\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Backfire-Causes.jpg\" alt=\"Chevy S10 Engine Sputtering Causes\" width=\"300\" height=\"297\"><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-117141\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The spark plug to the left was bad enough to cause a bad backfire and threw the <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0301-Chevy-S10\/\">P0301<\/a> trouble code, which indicated cylinder 1 had the misfire<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>If the plugs look fine, check the spark plug wires (if so equipped), make sure that they look good (not dry rotted, not melted).&nbsp; An old trick that you can do to check them is to make sure that they are not bleeding spark.&nbsp; Wait until it is dark, turn off the headlights and check under the hood.&nbsp; If you see spark coming from the wires, replace them and hopefully that will solve the problem.<\/p>\n<p>If the plug wires check out, you&#8217;ll need to test the coil packs themselves.&nbsp; You can do it with a voltmeter.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SZPiD7nv9Bw\">great video<\/a> to help you with that.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Fuel System Issues<\/h2>\n<p>The next item on the list would be the fuel system.&nbsp; The fuel system starts with the S10&#8217;s fuel pump, which will be in the gas tank.&nbsp; It sends fuel through the fuel lines and filter to your its fuel injectors.<\/p>\n<p>There needs to be enough fuel pressure for the fuel to properly atomize at the injectors.&nbsp; If there is not the engine will sputter like crazy, as it will be starved for fuel.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Diagnosis + Repair<\/h3>\n<p>Most vehicles have a port to manually check the fuel pressure.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a great place to start.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll have to look up where it is for your particular model year and engine combo.&nbsp; But, they usually aren&#8217;t hard to access.<\/p>\n<p>If the fuel pressure reading is below where it needs to be, checking and replacing the fuel filter would be the first thing to check.&nbsp; It&#8217;s easier to get to than the fuel pump.&nbsp; Otherwise, you&#8217;ll more than likely have to drop the tank and replace the fuel pump.<\/p>\n<p>Before going through all of that though, make sure to inspect the fuel lines for any crimping or damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If the pressure looks good, you&#8217;ll need to determine if the injectors are clogged or leaking.&nbsp; Smell for gas right after running the engine.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a strong indication that a fuel injector is leaking.&nbsp; If it is leaking, consider it a fire hazard and don&#8217;t run the engine again until the injector has been replaced.<\/p>\n<p>Further Reading:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Chevy-S10-bad-fuel-filter\">Chevy S10 Fuel Filter Diagnosis<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Chevy-S10-bad-fuel-pump-symptoms\/\">Chevy S10 Fuel Pump Diagnosis<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Bad Catalytic Converter<\/h2>\n<p>A bad catalytic converter will cause your S10&#8217;s engine to sputter.&nbsp; It scrubs the exhaust to remove pollutants.&nbsp; When a converter goes your vehicle is effectively choked.&nbsp; The two most obvious signs that one has gone bad will be engine sputtering and a <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/the-advanced-vehicular-odor-guide\/#1\">rotten egg smell<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Diagnosis + Repair<\/h3>\n<p>If the catalytic converter has gone bad, it will show itself the most when you need power.&nbsp; When the engine is idling, it may not sputter at all.&nbsp; As it revs up, more exhaust is created at one time.&nbsp; This leads to a back pressure increase, which chokes the engine from the exhaust side.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to replace the catalytic converter if it is clogged.&nbsp; The most common OBD II codes associated with this code are <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0420-Chevy-S10\/\">P0420<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0430-Chevy-S10\/\">P0430<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Keep your nose open you should smell a bad smell coming from a bad catalytic converter.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>MAF Sensor<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_168264\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-168264\" style=\"width: 291px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/MAF-Sensor-Loction.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-168264\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/MAF-Sensor-Loction.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"301\" height=\"201\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/MAF-Sensor-Loction.jpg 640w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/MAF-Sensor-Loction-300x201.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-168264\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Typical MAF Sensor Location<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The mass airflow, or MAF, sensor checks the air volume and temperature as it enters the engine.&nbsp; It&#8217;s one of the most important sensor that your S10 has.&nbsp; Just like the air filter that protects it, it can get dirty.&nbsp; When it gets dirty it can&#8217;t read the air entering the engine properly and your engine will sputter.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Diagnosis + Repair<\/h3>\n<p>The mass airflow sensor is really easy to get to.&nbsp; It&#8217;ll be between the intake manifold and the air filter.&nbsp; If you do have to clean it, make sure that you are using mass airflow sensor cleaner, and nothing else.&nbsp; Otherwise you can damage it.&nbsp;
