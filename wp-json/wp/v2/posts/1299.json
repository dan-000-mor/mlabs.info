\u00a0If so there could be an air pocket that is keeping the water from flowing through the engine.<\/li>\n<li>Bad water pump- \u00a0a good way to tell of the water pump has done bad is squeeze the top radiator hose with the engine on (be careful) and see if there is any pressure. \u00a0If you can easily squeeze the hose than it&#8217;s a great indication the water pump is not building pressure<\/li>\n<li>No antifreeze in the system- \u00a0it may sound silly, but a lot of people don&#8217;t know that just because the radiator overflow is full that the radiator is. \u00a0This is not the case at all. \u00a0With the engine cold, go ahead and see how much is actually in the radiator.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The car is not warming up<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Unlike the car overheating, which can be caused by a few issues, the engine not getting to operating temperature is almost a guarantee that there is an issue with the thermostat. \u00a0Often, people don&#8217;t really notice this until the first really cold day of the year. \u00a0They go to fire up the heater and there&#8217;s no heat.<\/p>\n<p>When the car overheats, the thermostat won&#8217;t open up (if it&#8217;s being caused by the thermostat). \u00a0When it doesn&#8217;t warm up the thermostat is stuck open. \u00a0When it opens it allows cooler water to enter the engine and cool it down. \u00a0When it stays open it never gives the engine a chance to reach its proper operating temp.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: \u00a0Where is the thermostat on a car located?<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s really not tough to find where the thermostat is located. \u00a0Also, it&#8217;s way cheaper than a radiator or water pump. \u00a0So, if your car is overheating, I hope that it&#8217;s the thermostat since it&#8217;s the cheapest one. \u00a0Good luck.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Traditionally finding the thermostat on a car or truck has been a relatively easy job. \u00a0It used to always be right there on top of the intake manifold. \u00a0Now, where the thermostat is located is going to depend a heck of a lot on whether the engine is transverse mounted or mounted longitudinally. \u00a0A basic &#8230; <a title=\"Where is the thermostat located?\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/where-is-the-thermostat-located\/\" aria-label=\"More on Where is the thermostat located?\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3,17],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1299"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1299"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1299\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1299"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1299"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1299"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
