Check the Oil<\/h3>\n<p>T<span style=\"color: #000000;\">he first thing that you should do is check the oil level. &nbsp;If it&#8217;s full make sure that it looks healthy. &nbsp;If it appears to be black or grimy, it may be interfering with the oil pressure sensor. &nbsp;If the wrong oil viscosity was used it can also trigger P0522 even with a full reading on the dipstick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. Inspect the Wiring Harness<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Next,&nbsp;you should inspect the wiring harness running from the oil pressure sensor to the PCM. &nbsp;If it has any damaged wiring, that could be causing P0522. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t forget to make sure that the harness is still plugged into the sending unit and undamaged. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Wiring issues are one of the more common reasons that this code is thrown. &nbsp;The wiring is close to the Rav4&#8217;s exhaust and can get brittle over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. Manually Check The Oil Pressure<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Assuming that the oil level and wiring look fine, the next thing to do would be to manually check the oil pressure. &nbsp;You can use a <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2PG95Oi\">manual oil pressure<\/a> gauge to see if it&#8217;s where it needs to be. &nbsp;They are easy to use. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s a <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=I8teB16U0LA\">great YouTube video<\/a> that will show you exactly how to use this gauge to check.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">If the oil pressure from the gauge reads ok, you&#8217;ll need to replace the oil pressure sending unit\/sensor. &nbsp;<a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=Toyota+Rav4+oil+pressure+sensor&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=35efdabba43e435a073e20447574ee0b&amp;language=en_US\">They&#8217;re cheap<\/a>. &nbsp;If there is low or no oil pressure, you&#8217;ll need to figure out why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Conclusion: &nbsp;P0522 Toyota Rav4<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It&#8217;s relatively straightforward diagnosing P0522. &nbsp;Knowing the actual oil pressure level makes it a lot easier. &nbsp;Feel free to leave a comment below if there is something that you would like to add and good luck fixing your Toyota Rav4!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; P0522 is an OBD2 diagnostic code that is triggered when your Toyota Rav4 detects that the value being sent from the oil pressure sensor is below its normal operating ranged.
