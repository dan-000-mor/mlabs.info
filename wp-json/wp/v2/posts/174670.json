Check the Fuse<\/h2>\n<p>If none of the brake lights are working, we are going to follow the circuit from the fuse box back to the brake pedal.&nbsp; At some point the power is not getting from point A to point B.&nbsp; We just have to find where that is.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that tail lights can work even if the brake lights are burned out.&nbsp; It is entirely possible that all the brake lights burned out at the same time.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Stop-Light-Fuse.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-174663\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Stop-Light-Fuse-913x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Toyota Camry Brake Lights Not Working Fix\" width=\"400\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Stop-Light-Fuse-913x1024.jpg 913w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Stop-Light-Fuse-268x300.jpg 268w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Stop-Light-Fuse-768x861.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Stop-Light-Fuse.jpg 1022w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The first thing that you should do if all of the brake lights are not working is check the fuse.&nbsp; It&#8217;ll be clearly labeled.&nbsp; It usually says something along the lines of &#8220;stop lamps&#8221; or stop.&nbsp; You can pull it and visually inspect it to make sure that it is not broken.<\/p>\n<p>Even if it looks fine, if you have another fuse of the same amperage, swap it anyway.&nbsp; What works better is using a simple <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/JASTIND-Automotive-Extended-Replacement-Indicator\/dp\/B07Q3622FT\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&amp;keywords=test+light&amp;qid=1598011211&amp;sr=8-5&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=a50f0c07ceb95728214b32d13108c651&amp;language=en_US\">electrical test light<\/a> to determine if the circuit works.&nbsp; Wal-Mart and any parts store will keep them in stock, usually at $10 or less.<\/p>\n<p>Just hook the clip of the light up to a good ground and touch the two metal tabs on top of the fuse.&nbsp; There is no need to pull the fuse for this.&nbsp; It should be &#8220;hot&#8221; on both sides.&nbsp; If it is not, replace the fuse.&nbsp; If it blows more than once, it&#8217;s likely that your Camry&#8217;s wiring harness has been damaged on the way to the brake lights.&nbsp; Make sure to put the same size fuse back in<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>2. Check your Camry\u2019s Brake Light Switch<\/h2>\n<p>Ok, now we&#8217;ve confirmed that there is power going to the brake light circuit, it&#8217;s time to figure out where in the path from the fuse box to the brake lights the power is lost.&nbsp; The most common location is the&nbsp;<strong>brake light switch<\/strong>.&nbsp; The good news is they are inexpensive and easy to replace.<\/p>\n<p>Your Camry\u2019s brake light switch is under the brake pedal.&nbsp; It ALWAYS should have power running to it, even if the key is off.&nbsp; We need definitely need a test light at this point.&nbsp; The video below shows exactly how to do this.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He has the brake light switch out of the vehicle, which makes it way easier to see.&nbsp; You do not need to do this.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Basically, there are two wires, one is alway hot.&nbsp; When you press the brake pedal down, it sends this power to the brake lights.&nbsp; This is the most likely failure point.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/QXSsWtXpJmw?start=111\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>If your vehicle has cruise control, it may appear as though there are two brake switches.&nbsp; The other one is to tell the cruise control to turn off when you press the brake pedal.&nbsp; You may need to consult your manual to determine which one is which.&nbsp; But, as a general rule, the cruise control switch will not have power going to it when the key is off like the brake light switch does.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>3. Check for a Bad Ground<\/h2>\n<p>If there is a ground wire running to the brake light switch, make sure that it is secured tightly and corrosion free.&nbsp; If you can&#8217;t find the ground wire at all, run a jumper wire to substitute for the ground wire.<\/p>\n<p>Now test the brake light switch.&nbsp; If it works, fix the ground wire.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>4. Other Wiring Issues<\/h2>\n<p>If your Camry&#8217;s brake light switch checked out ok, and there are no brake lights illuminating at all, inspect the wiring harness going from the brake switch to the bulbs themselves.&nbsp; There could be an issue with frayed wiring, wiring that has lost its ground, or a short\/open situation.<\/p>\n<p>If you have the &#8220;third&#8221; or dedicated brake light (the one not in your tail lights), check the harness&nbsp;<strong>after they diverge<\/strong>.&nbsp; You know that it has power before this point since the third brake light is still getting power.<\/p>\n<p>Look in the trunk (if applicable).&nbsp; Check any grounds the harness has in there.&nbsp; Make sure that the harness wasn&#8217;t damaged in there.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not uncommon for cargo to do this.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion:&nbsp; Toyota Camry Brake Lights Not Coming On<\/h2>\n<p>If your Camry&#8217;s brake lights are not working, it&#8217;s most likely going to be caused by a bad brake light switch.&nbsp; Good luck fixing your vehicle!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Brake lights are one of the most critical safety features that your Toyota Camry has.&nbsp; They let other drivers know when you are slowing down, and that they need to slow down too.&nbsp; If your brake lights aren&#8217;t working, you&#8217;re way more likely to get rear ended than normal.&nbsp; The good news is that troubleshooting &#8230; <a title=\"Toyota Camry:&nbsp; Brake Lights Not Working Diagnosis\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/toyota-camry-brake-lights-not-working\/\" aria-label=\"More on Toyota Camry:&nbsp; Brake Lights Not Working Diagnosis\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[248],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/174670"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=174670"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/174670\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=174670"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=174670"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=174670"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
