Toyota Yaris<\/h2>\n<p>There will always be trouble codes associated with the check engine light blinking.&nbsp; These trouble codes will be able to tell you where to start hunting down the problem.&nbsp; Here are the most common issues that end up causing the check engine light to flash.&nbsp; But, follow the OBDII codes.&nbsp; &nbsp;A <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2Vm42Iv\">code scanner is cheap<\/a>.&nbsp; Use it to find out exactly why your vehicles computer decided to flash this light.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Yaris Check Engine Light Flashing Due to Ignition Issues<\/h2>\n<p>The ignition system is the most common reason that the check engine light will flash.&nbsp; The ignition system consists of spark plugs, plug wires, and the ignition coil packs (older vehicles have a distributer that has the same function as coil packs).&nbsp; These parts work in concert to ignite the fuel in the combustion chamber at just the right time.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0300-Toyota-Yaris\/\">P0300:&nbsp; Random Multiple Misfire<\/a>&#8211;&nbsp; This is one of the most common codes that is thrown when the engine is misfiring.&nbsp; It means that the engine has a misfire, but the computer can&#8217;t detect which cylinder that it&#8217;s coming from.&nbsp; This code is often thrown when there is a&nbsp;<strong>fuel<\/strong> issue, or a <strong>timing issue<\/strong>, and not just bad ignition components.&nbsp; That is unless all the cylinders share a common coil (distributor ignition).&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0301-Toyota-Yaris\/\">P0301<\/a>-P0312:&nbsp; Cylinder Specific Misfire-&nbsp; These trouble codes correspond with a specific cylinder misfiring (cylinder number corresponds with its place in the firing order).&nbsp; Although it&#8217;s a bad sign when the service engine soon light flashes, when one of these codes comes up with it (and nothing else), it&#8217;s almost always one spark plug or ignition coil.&nbsp; There can be other reasons this code is thrown, you can see more by clicking on the P0301 link above.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are other misfire related codes as well, but those are the most common ones.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Flashing-Check-Engine-Light-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66898\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Flashing-Check-Engine-Light-Diagnosis.png\" alt=\"Toyota Yaris Blinking Check Engine Light Diagnosis\" width=\"255\" height=\"188\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Fuel System Issues&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<p>Keeping in mind that any engine needs air, fuel, and spark for ignition, your Toyota Yaris&#8217;s fuel system can often cause the engine to misfire.&nbsp; It can run too lean or rich.&nbsp; Alternatively, there may not be enough fuel for proper combustion, or the fuel isn&#8217;t atomizing properly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fuel Mixture:&nbsp; If the engine is running rich or lean, the engine will misfire and throw the fuel mixture related codes, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0171-Toyota-Yaris\/\">P0171<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0172-Toyota-Yaris\/\">P0172<\/a>, etc..<\/li>\n<li>Injector Issues:&nbsp; A bad fuel injector(s) can cause a misfire.&nbsp; If the fuel can&#8217;t atomize properly, the engine will misfire.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https:\/\/procarmechanics.com\/easy-tips-to-diagnose-a-faulty-fuel-injector\/\">good article<\/a> on how to diagnose whether your fuel injectors are bad from procarmechanics.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Other Issues:&nbsp; Flashing Check Engine Light- Toyota Yaris<\/h2>\n<p>While a majority of the time, the flashing check engine light is going to be caused by a misfire related to your Yaris&#8217;s ignition system or fuel system (as stated above), there are other issues that can cause it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/timing-chain-jumped-symptoms-and-diagnosis\/\">timing chain could have jumped<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>If you have VVT, it may be having issues.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>EGR- The EGR system recycles burnt exhaust gasses back into the combustion chamber.<\/li>\n<li>Crank\/Cam Sensor-&nbsp; When the cam or crank sensors are not being read by the ECM\/PCM, it&#8217;s impossible to get the ignition timing right.&nbsp; If you Yaris does start at all, it&#8217;ll run rough.<\/li>\n<li>It could be a more serious mechanical issue, such as as bent valve, bad lifter, etc&#8230;.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>We recommend that you don&#8217;t drive your vehicle if at all possible until you diagnose and fix your Yaris&#8217;s flashing check engine light.&nbsp; Just pretend that it&#8217;s letting you know that it&#8217;s going to cost you way more money to fix the problem if you keep driving it.&nbsp; If there is anything that you would like to add, please feel free to leave a comment below.&nbsp;
