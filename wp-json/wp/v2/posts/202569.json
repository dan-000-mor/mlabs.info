However, it shouldn&#8217;t leave you stranded, just down on power.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>1.

So if you do have a code, it&#8217;ll tell you which one it is.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>2. Loss of Fuel Mileage<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-202532 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Empty-Gas-Gauge.jpg\" alt=\"Bad Knock Sensor Symptoms: Toyota Tacoma\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Empty-Gas-Gauge.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Empty-Gas-Gauge-300x150.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Everything about your Tacoma&#8217;s engine is designed for optimum combustion. &nbsp;Optimum combustion gets your vehicle the best fuel mileage that the engine can manage.<\/p>\n<p>The PCM uses the data from the knock sensors to determine if the timing has been too far advanced.&nbsp; If it is, it&#8217;ll back the timing down.&nbsp; This keeps the engine safe from detonation but decreases fuel mileage, and allows for aggressive timing that wouldn&#8217;t be possible without it.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>3.

Noises<\/h2>\n<p>In the worst of circumstances, you may hear some knocking or pinging sounds. &nbsp;This would indicate a misfire. However, not every engine relies so heavily on its knock sensor to cause a misfire.<\/p>\n<p>If you get misfire-related and knock sensor codes, you&#8217;re going to want to address the bad knock sensor first, as that will more than likely take care of the misfire issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If the <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Tacoma-flashing-check-engine-light\/\">check engine light is flashing<\/a>, that means big trouble (keeping the engine running could potentially damage the catalytic converter).<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Conclusion: Toyota Tacoma Bad Knock Sensor<\/h2>\n<p>A bad knock sensor will not usually be a breakdown risk. &nbsp;But, you should take care of it right away. &nbsp;Replacing it isn&#8217;t usually too difficult.<\/p>\n<p>Replacing the knock sensor will usually take care of the problem.&nbsp; If your Tacoma has any trouble codes, start there.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Modern vehicles use knock sensors to detect engine detonation. &nbsp;This allows the PCM (powertrain control module) to run very aggressive spark timing.&nbsp; If you are concerned that your Toyota Tacoma has a bad knock sensor, we&#8217;ve listed them out below.
