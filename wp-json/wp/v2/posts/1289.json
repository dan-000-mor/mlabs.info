VS 700R4 Differences"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>While both the 200-4R and the <a href=\"\/\">700R4<\/a> came out at about the same time, there are quite a few differences between them. \u00a0The nice thing about them now is that while they both had their shortcomings when they were first released, they have been ironed out. \u00a0The only exception to this would be if you are looking at stock versions of these transmissions, which are becoming almost impossible to find.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, they have been massaged so well that either transmission makes a great addition to a muscle car that still an old three speed <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/\">GM automatic<\/a>. \u00a0They both will bolt right up to any car that has a TH350 or TH400. \u00a0Real world fuel economy improvements are often as good as 30%. \u00a0Maybe even more important though is that your car won&#8217;t scream down the highway anymore.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>700R4 VS 200-4R Similarities<\/h2>\n<p>These two transmissions are so similar, it&#8217;s almost a wonder that the factory produced them both.<\/p>\n<h4>TV Cable<\/h4>\n<p>They are both controlled by a TV Cable, which is a big upgrade from the old kickdown cable of old found on the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/turbo-hydramatic-350\/\">TH350<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/th400\/\">TH400<\/a>. \u00a0This TV cable basically acts as a primitive throttle position sensor, which allows each of these transmissions to shift smoother and stay at the best rpm possible for peak performance and fuel economy.<\/p>\n<p>The TV Cable is known to be a little finicky. \u00a0Is is one of the most common <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/700r4-transmission-troubleshooting\/\">700R4 problems<\/a>. \u00a0If it&#8217;s even out of adjustment a little bit, it can cause the 700R4 or the 2004R to shift really hard, really early, or really late.<\/p>\n<h4>Overdrive<\/h4>\n<p>They both have overdrive gears, which is a first for GM automatic transmissions. \u00a0It was ground breaking at the time. \u00a0Todays modern <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/4l60e-identification\/\">4L60E<\/a> is a direct descendent of the 700R4. \u00a0This basic design and .70:1 overdrive gear are still present in it with minimum changes. \u00a0The 2004R is a bit more aggressive with a ratio of .67:1.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>700R4 VS 200-4R Differences<\/h2>\n<h4>Gearing<\/h4>\n<p>The overdrive gear in the 2004R is .67:1, which is a bit more aggressive of an overdrive than the 700R4. \u00a0This means that the rpm is even lower when driving down the highway with the 2004R.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"156\"><strong>Gear<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"156\"><strong>700R4\/4L60<\/strong><\/td>\n<td

together than the 700R4, which makes it a better transmission for drag racing.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Telling Them Apart<\/h2>\n<p>The easiest way to tell any automatic GM transmission from the other is to use the pan bolt count and pattern. \u00a0It&#8217;s a bit more challenging with the 2004R vs 700R4, as they have the same pan bolt count, which is 16 bolts.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to go about telling these two transmissions from one another is going to be to count the pan angles. \u00a0The 700R4 is almost a perfect <strong>4 angled square<\/strong>. \u00a0 On the other hand, the 2004R has <strong>6 angles<\/strong> and looks more like the state of Nevada. \u00a0Please use the pic below to help you get a visual.<\/p>\n<p>For way more on this the <a
