There are other causes as well. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here are the most common causes of P0336:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>1. Bad Crank Sensor<\/h3>\n<p>The crankshaft sensor is often the reason that P0336 is thrown. They <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=aps&amp;field-keywords=Mazda+6+Crankshaft+Sensor&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=071e819801958a5d224d6f172c1d4fb1&amp;language=en_US\">aren&#8217;t very expensive<\/a>, but they can be difficult to get to in order to service them. If you think you&#8217;re up to the challenge (and know how to use a voltmeter) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.doityourself.com\/stry\/how-to-test-a-crankshaft-position-sensor\">this guide<\/a> from doityourself.com will show you exactly how to test the sensor.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. Reluctor Ring<\/h3>\n<p>The crank sensor operates by scanning a &#8220;reluctor wheel&#8221;. This wheel can become damaged over time and will no longer give a proper reading to the ECM.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most common symptoms of a bad reluctor ring is going to be a <strong>rattling sound<\/strong>. If the engine still runs, you will hear it. This means that it has been damaged, and no longer seated properly.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t hear a rattle, the ring could have broken or missing teeth. This will cause your 6 to not get a good reading from the crank sensor.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. Wiring Issues<\/h3>\n<p>Due to the location of the crankshaft position sensor, it is prone to damage. Start by inspecting the wiring harness between the firewall and crank sensor for any obvious damage. After that it would be prudent to look at the wiring harness plug at the sensor itself.<\/p>\n<p>This YouTube video shows exactly how to test the wiring integrity, it&#8217;s for <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0335-Mazda-6\/\">P0335<\/a>, and is totally applicable for P0336.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MqEvKtwXVoM\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. Less Likely Reasons<\/h3>\n<p>Most of the time, the reasons outlined above are going to be the problem. But, not always. Here are some issues that are (not quite as) known to cause P0336 in the 6:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Timing Belt\/Chain<\/strong>&#8211; It is possible that a vehicle that has jumped timing is throwing the code.
