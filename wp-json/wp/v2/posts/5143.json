Have somebody stand behind your F250, and put it in reverse. Have them tell you if the back up lights come on. If the back up lights don&#8217;t come on that means that the vehicle is not getting that instruction from the shifter (unless for some crazy reason they are both blown). This can happen when things get out of alignment. Now that you are back there, go ahead and see if the reverse lights come on in any gear. It may have been a bigger problem than you realized<\/p>\n<p><strong>Blown Fuse<\/strong>&#8211; One of the most common causes of a bad back up camera in the Ford F250 is a bad fuse. The first time that you experience a bad fuse, it should be cause for concern, but not alarm. Go ahead and install a new fuse, and if the problem goes away you&#8217;re good to go. If the problem persists, then it&#8217;s time to look at the possibility that you have a short-circuit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bad Camera<\/strong>&#8211; These cameras are exposed to the elements, which means that they have to be pretty durable. They certainly can go bad. With the Ford F250 in particular, they can go out. Tap your inner Fonzie, and give it a flick. It very well could turn back on again. If it does come back to life, you know it&#8217;s going bad.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Short Circuit<\/strong>&#8211; While it&#8217;s not the most likely of causes, the a short-circuit can cause the reverse camera to stop functioning.
