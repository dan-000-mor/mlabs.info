\u00a0It can be a pretty scary feeling.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This is caused by<\/strong>\u00a0a burned out 3-4 clutch pack. \u00a0And, the 3-4 clutch pack is done in by the 3-4 piston. \u00a0There is a giant rubber O-ring around the piston that will shrink due to heat and age. \u00a0 Nearly everyone is going to have to take it on in for a rebuild. \u00a0 Replacing the clutches in an automatic transmission is not a job that is easily done whatsoever. \u00a0There is a lot that can get messed up in the 4L60E<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4L60E\u00a0has forward gears, but no reverse<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This is also a pretty common issue with the 4L60E. \u00a0More than likely the reverse input snap ring has sheared or snapped off. It can also be caused by the sun shell breaking. \u00a0The most common problem is probably going to be the low reverse clutch pack. \u00a0The booster valve could also be an issue.<\/p>\n<p>Below is a pretty good video on common causes of 4L60E reverse going out.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/12skIuk6rsE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3>Harsh shifting<\/h3>\n<p>Many people will bring their vehicle in and complain that the transmission is <strong>shifting really hard between first and second gear<\/strong>. \u00a0This is another really common problem with the 4L60E. \u00a0It would probably be a good idea to check the throttle position sensor and see if it is within it&#8217;s normal operating parameters.<\/p>\n<p>Here is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yourmechanic.com\/article\/symptoms-of-a-bad-or-failing-throttle-position-sensor\">good article<\/a>\u00a0on TPS issues.<\/p>\n<p>Below is a good video on TPS diagnosis.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/l30-TNXj9Qc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><br \/>\nIf you&#8217;ve had problems with the 4L60E after a rebuild, check this <a href=\"http:\/\/ls1tech.com\/forums\/automatic-transmission\/1627918-4l60e-problem-after-rebuild-please-help.html\">article<\/a> from LS1tech.com.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever is going on with your transmission, I hope that you are successful in fixing it, and you don&#8217;t end up losing an arm and a leg on repairing your 4L60E. \u00a0Good Luck!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The 4L60E transmission is the direct descendent of the 700R4, and as such already had over a decade of refinement put into it before it ever even made it into production. \u00a0This means that even the early ones were pretty good from day one of their production life. \u00a0While there have been many case changes &#8230; <a title=\"4L60E Transmission Problems\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/4l60e-transmission-problems\/\" aria-label=\"More on 4L60E Transmission Problems\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[8,3],"tags":[31,46,45],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/843"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=843"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/843\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=843"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=843"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=843"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
