You&#8217;ll still need a custom kick down bracket and a way to hook into the vacuum port on the engine.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0<b>Engaging the Torque Converter<\/b>&#8211; \u00a0The TH350 and 4L60E both need an adapter to correctly engage the flywheel if the TH350 is going to run behind an LS motor, or if the 4L60E is going to run behind a classic motor it&#8217;ll need an adapter too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">More info on this can be found not the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/ls-engine-swap-transmission-guide\/\">LS Swap Transmission<\/a>\u00a0guide.<\/p>\n<p>There are many other differences between the two transmissions that are noteworthy as well. \u00a0This is a broad take on these differences.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Overdrive<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0If how they are controlled is of no concern to you, it still may be worth noting the TH350 has no overdrive gear like the 4L60E, which means that an engine with the TH350 is going to run down the highway at a lot higher of an RPM than the 4L60E. \u00a0The TH350 has three forward gears and the 4L60E has four.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Locking Torque Converter<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0The 4L60E has a locking torque converter, which means that a clutch will engage at a high enough speed and allow for a true direct connection between the engine and transmission. \u00a0This increases fuel economy and slightly lowers RPM going down the road. \u00a0You have to set up wiring to make it work in a car that it was never equipped with.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Length<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0The TH350 is a shorter transmission, so if you were going to swap one for the other, you&#8217;d need to have your driveshaft resized or replaced.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bellhousing Bolt Pattern<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0The TH350 has a bolt at the 12 o&#8217;clock position that most Gen III 4L60E transmissions just do not have. \u00a0It&#8217;s not an issue to bolt one where the other was. \u00a0Just use whatever bolts line up properly.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Case<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0The TH350 uses a two piece case ( body, tail shaft), and the 4L60E has used a three-piece (bellhousing, body, tail shaft) and a two piece design. \u00a0A two piece design is always an earlier 4L60E and was probably bolted behind an SBC originally. \u00a0For more on the differences in the 4L60E over the years and how to ID one please visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/4l60e-identification\/\">4L60E identification<\/a> page.<\/li>\n<li><strong>VSS\/Speedometer<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0The TH350 uses a speedometer gear to turn the speedometer, while the 4L60E uses a Vehicle Speed Sensor to relay speed data to the vehicles computer, which in turn tells the speedometer how fast the vehicle is moving.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There are many differences between these two transmissions. \u00a0This should give you a basic idea of what would be involved in swapping one for the other, as well as what the major differences between the TH350 vs 4L60E are. \u00a0Good luck!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The TH350 was GM&#8217;s go to transmission for light duty vehicles for at least 20 years. \u00a0Beginning in the early nineties, the 4L60E began to be the go to transmission for GM light duty cars and trucks. \u00a0When comparing the TH350 vs the 4L60E, there are many differences.
