The LM7 hot idle oil PSI is usually 35.  Twenty five PSI suggests the engine is relatively worn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Is a Normal Operating Oil Pressure?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your engine oil should reach its normal operating pressure after running for about 20 minutes. The pressure gauge needle should remain steady at the midpoint if your vehicle has an oil gauge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A truck\u2019s oil pressure generally ranges from 30 to 70 PSI during operation. Anything lower is cause for alarm, as your engine will shut off. Anything higher can also cause damage to your vehicle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most truck drivers with LM7 engines average 45 PSI when they\u2019re driving at 70 miles per hour. Pushing your truck to speed up or driving uphill can change the pressure temporarily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Do You Know if Your Oil Pressure Is Wrong?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The clearest sign that your oil pressure is wrong is when the warning light comes on. It\u2019s an image of an oil can with a drop coming out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this light could mean that you must top off your oil, your oil is leaking, or the pump\u2019s broken.&nbsp; The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) will activate an insufficient oil warning if the oil level is too low.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll know you have low engine oil pressure by signs such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Engine loses power or stalls<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Burning oil smell when your car runs<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Engine louder than normal when running<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Car overheats when you drive it<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Oil pressure warning<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Test Your Oil Pressure<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mechanical Gauge<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=btsrCATwqxA\">test your engine\u2019s oil pressure<\/a> with a specialized tool and an extra person, though you won\u2019t need any mechanical skills beyond that. You can find the oil pressure sender on the engine block or check your owner\u2019s manual for more details.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mount the oil pressure tester according to its instructions. Let the engine idle for five minutes so it reaches operating pressure. Check your vehicle\u2019s instructions to see what RPM you need to determine the oil pressure, for the LM7, that\u2019s 40 PSI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other person stays in the car and maintains that RPM while you take the pressure readings. Then turn off the engine, let it cool, and remove the oil pressure tool. If your oil pressure is ideal while it\u2019s operating, you can drive safely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Scan Tool<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can hook a scan tool into the OBDII reader and get an oil pressure reading directly from the sensor if you have a reason not to trust the gauge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other Ways to Know if an Engine is Good or Bad<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is written from the perspective of trying to help someone determine if the LM7 equipped vehicle they are looking at has a good engine.&nbsp; Other than the hot idle oil pressure, here are some good ways to tell if the engine is good or not:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Blue smoke- indicates that the piston rings have worn out.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Check engine light- The check engine light isn\u2019t a deal breaker for the LM7.&nbsp; They notoriously get EVAP related trouble codes, but that won\u2019t affect the way the engine runs at all.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Listen for knocking- Does the engine knock or tick when running it?&nbsp; If you do hear a tick, look at all the bolts where the exhaust manifold connects to the cylinder head.&nbsp; They are known for shearing.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Check the oil- If they oil is foamy or sludgy, it could indicate a larger problem.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final Notes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Proper vehicle maintenance can help you notice when something isn\u2019t right. The symptoms of high or low oil pressure are easy to detect if you pay attention. The LM7 hot idle oil PSI is 25 to 35. This knowledge ensures you can test your engine pressure and know that everything runs as it should.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Chevrolet 5.3 Vortec engine is one of the most reliable engines ever built.
