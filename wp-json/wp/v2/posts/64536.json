Honda Passport<\/h2>\n<p>Since the EGR valve is part of the emissions system, there really isn&#8217;t going to be much in the way of symptoms.&nbsp; Usually, all you&#8217;ll see is the check engine light.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>P0405 Causes and Solutions:&nbsp; Honda Passport<\/h2>\n<p>Almost all of the time, P0405 is going to be caused by wiring issues or a bad EGR Valve.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll go over both of them in better detail directly below.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/P0405.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-63089\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/P0405-300x216.png\" alt=\"Honda Passport P0405 Diagnosis\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/P0405-300x216.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/P0405.png 414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Bad EGR Valve<\/h3>\n<p>If you happen to have a good scan tool, you can actually use it to command the EGR valve to open.&nbsp; If the EGR valve refuses to open it would be time to check the wiring harness for voltage at the plug that goes into the EGR.&nbsp; If the voltage is OK, then replacing the EGR valve may be a good idea.&nbsp; There&#8217;s plenty on testing this wiring in the next section.<\/p>\n<p>Carbon, junk, and even ice can cause the EGR circuit to stick.&nbsp; The most common cause of P0405 is the EGR valve.&nbsp; But, blindly replacing it without testing it can be a waste of money.<\/p>\n<p>If it does end up being the EGR valve, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=Honda+Passport+EGR&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=b860e4d553d034ea0954bdb319f79c23&amp;language=en_US\">they are pretty affordable<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Wiring Issues<\/h3>\n<p>A great place to start diagnosing P0405 in your Passport is going to be the wiring harness.&nbsp; Being that the wiring harness that goes to the EGR valve is by the hot engine it has a higher propensity to fail than other wiring in the vehicle, it is often the problem.<\/p>\n<p>Find the wiring harness where it starts at the EGR valve.&nbsp; Does the plugin have any visible signs of damage?&nbsp; If it doesn&#8217;t, go ahead and inspect the wiring harness for any damage.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll be looking for frayed wiring.&nbsp; Look close at any place that it may come into contact with the engine, frame, or anywhere that it takes a sharp turn.<\/p>\n<p>To check the voltage at the harness, you&#8217;ll need a volt meter.&nbsp; Check the voltage at the reference circuit.&nbsp; If it&#8217;s at 5 volts, but the EGR Valve won&#8217;t open, that&#8217;s a pretty good indication that the EGR is bad.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you get 12 volts or 0 volts, that would be an indication of a wiring problem.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s a great writeup on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aa1car.com\/library\/tselec.htm\">diagnosing your wiring issues<\/a> from AA1Car.com<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Most of the time, when P0405 is thrown, it&#8217;ll be the EGR valve that is the cause.&nbsp; It is still a good idea to test it and the wiring before buying a new one though.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If there is anything that you would like to add, please leave a comment below.&nbsp; Good luck diagnosing your Passport!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
