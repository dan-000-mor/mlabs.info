The squealer is a piece of metal that begins touching the caliper when the brakes are worn to a level that they should be replaced.&nbsp; At this level, the vehicle is still safe to drive, but the brake pads should be replaced as soon as possible.&nbsp; If they are not replaced, the brake pads will eventually wear down and you&#8217;ll get a metal on metal situation.&nbsp; At this point, it will no longer be a squeak that you&#8217;ll hear.&nbsp; Instead, it&#8217;ll be a horrible grinding sound.<\/p>\n<p>Shoes are what applies pressure to the drum brakes to get them to slow down the vehicle. &nbsp;With drums, once all of the metal on the shoe is worn off it&#8217;ll begin to make a metallic or grinding sound.&nbsp; Bad shoes are tougher to detect before they are worn all of the way down.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2:&nbsp; Anti Rattle Clip<\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_65859\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65859\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Anti-Rattle-Clip.jpeg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-65859 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Anti-Rattle-Clip-300x225.jpeg\" alt=\"Typical Anti-Rattle Clip\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Anti-Rattle-Clip-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Anti-Rattle-Clip-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Anti-Rattle-Clip-1024x768.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-65859\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Typical Anti-Rattle Clip<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Most modern vehicles have anti-rattle clips.&nbsp; These clips keep the brake pads from bouncing around between the caliper and the rotor when the brakes are not being pressed.&nbsp; If they are damaged or installed improperly, it can cause the brakes to squeal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If the anti rattle clips are entirely missing, you&#8217;ll typically hear a &#8220;thunk&#8221; noise as they rattle around there.&nbsp; Eventually the brakes will start to squeal without them as they glaze and wear unevenly.&nbsp; There&#8217;s more on glazing below.&nbsp; These clips are important.&nbsp; If you have reason to believe that they are damaged or missing, you should replace them.<\/p>\n<h3>3:&nbsp; Glazing<\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_65858\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65858\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Glazed-Brake-Pad.jpeg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-65858 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Glazed-Brake-Pad-300x225.jpeg\" alt=\"Nissan Patrol Brake Squeal Diagnosis\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\"><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-65858\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This brake pad is glazed and not worn unevenly<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Glazing is a condition that happens when the brake pads, shoes, rotors, or drums get too hot for too long.&nbsp; Glazing hardens the contact surface of your pads, and diminishes their overall braking performance.&nbsp; Squeaking brakes are just a side effect of this condition.&nbsp; If you Nissan Patrol has glazed brake pads, they need to be replaced.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/h8HJmfYxgH0?t=20\">Watch Brakes Get Hot: YouTube<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4:&nbsp; Pad Insulation<\/h3>\n<p>There is supposed to be a small backing shim that goes between the brake pad and the caliper.&nbsp; This can become lost or damaged as time goes by.&nbsp; Most vehicles have this.&nbsp; If there is a problem with the shims or pad insulation, it&#8217;ll usually occur&nbsp;<strong>right after<\/strong> a brake job.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>5: &nbsp;Rotors<\/h3>\n<p>When the brake rotors get an uneven surface, glazing, or are worn too far down they&#8217;ll cause a squeaking sound. &nbsp;Your mechanic can &#8220;turn&#8221; them, which cuts a new even surface back on to them. &nbsp;Otherwise, if they are worn too far, you&#8217;ll need to install new ones.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Nissan Patrol Brake Squeak Diagnosis<\/h2>\n<p>It can be tough to nail down the exact reason why brakes squeak. &nbsp;The most important safety feature on your Patrol is its ability to stop. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t ignore the squeak, and good luck diagnosing it. &nbsp;If there is anything that you would like to add, please feel free to leave a comment below.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Your Nissan Patrol&#8216;s braking system is designed to handle thousands of miles of braking with no intervention from you.&nbsp; When its brakes begin to squeak, they are telling you that they need some attention.
