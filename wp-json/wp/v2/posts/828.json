drive \u00a0Chevrolet passenger car with no problem. \u00a0Tunnel modification can come into play on some of the smaller cars. \u00a0The TH350 uses a mechanical kick down switch, whereas the TH400 uses an electric one. \u00a0The electric kick down is much easier to set up, espescially if you are doing an <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/ls-engine-swap-transmission-guide\/\">LS Swap<\/a>,<\/p>\n<p>They do <strong>both have an aluminum case<\/strong>, and three forward gears. \u00a0Although the gear ratios are nominally different. \u00a0Neither transmission has any sort of computer control to it, nor did they use locking converters.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of people claim that he <strong>TH350 has less drivetrain loss<\/strong> than the TH400, which means that all things being equal, the TH350 is going to get more power to the rear wheels from an engine with equal power. \u00a0This is due to more rotating weight existing in the larger TH400 case. \u00a0Here is a writeup on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thirdgen.org\/forums\/organized-drag-racing-autocross\/591300-et-loss-th350-th400.html\">ET loss from TH350 to TH400<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>They also don&#8217;t weight the same amount. \u00a0The Turbo 350 weights 150pounds while a Turbo 400 weighs almost 170.<\/p>\n<h1>Which one is right for you?<\/h1>\n<p>If you are going to buy a stock transmission and know it&#8217;ll fit in your vehicle, without a doubt the TH400 is the way to go. \u00a0It&#8217;s super durable and will provide a long life of useful service with no modification from stock, even in higher horsepower situations.<\/p>\n<p>If you are buying an aftermarket transmission from someone like TCI or Monster transmission, I&#8217;d say go with the TH350. \u00a0These folks have had decades to get all the flaws and weakness out of it. \u00a0You&#8217;ll have less mass in the drivetrain and a lighter transmission.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for reading!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Related: \u00a0<a
