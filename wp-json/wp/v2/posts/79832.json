&nbsp;Brake pads come with little pieces of metal attached to them called squealers. &nbsp;These squealers let you know that the pad is worn to a critically low point. &nbsp;Usually they are really easy to hear. &nbsp;The brakes will squeal any time that you press them down. &nbsp;Sometimes they&#8217;ll even squeal without pressing the brake pedal at all. &nbsp;If you ignore the squealing long enough, the brakes will run out of material and they&#8217;ll start grinding against the calipers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Foreign Object<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;It is entirely possible for a piece of debris to get lodged between the caliper and the rotor. &nbsp;In this case, the debris will cause a terrible grinding sound when you press your Patrol&#8217;s brake pedal down.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Brakes-Grinding-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-79088\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Brakes-Grinding-Diagnosis.png\" alt=\"Nissan Patrol Brakes Grinding Diagnosis\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Brakes-Grinding-Diagnosis.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Brakes-Grinding-Diagnosis-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Worn brake pads or a stuck foreign object are usually going to be the issue causing your Nissan Patrol&#8217;s brakes to grind. &nbsp;Here are some other issues that can cause brakes to grind, but aren&#8217;t quite as common.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Worn Rotor<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;If a rotor gets too thin, it can warp. &nbsp;This problem actually happens more on modern vehicles. &nbsp;As manufacturers have continued to find ways to improve fuel mileage, rotor materials are often thinned to improve unsprung weight. &nbsp;If your Patrol&#8217;s rotors are warped they can make a grinding noise.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Broken Shims<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;A shim that has worn out can make contact with the brake hardware and cause the grinding noise. &nbsp;Shims are one of the more overlooked items when doing a brake job.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lack of Lubrication<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;Brake caliper bolts help the caliper adjust as the brake pads wear down. &nbsp;If they need lubrication, the caliper can hang up and potentially grind.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bad Replacement Pads<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;Cheap or poorly made brake pads can cause damage, much in the same way that having worn the pad down too long would. &nbsp;The material used to make them can be to large or wear unevenly, digging into and damaging your Patrol&#8217;s rotors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Driving your Patrol with grinding brakes is dangerous. &nbsp;Brakes that are grinding lose their ability to stop the vehicle reliably. &nbsp;Have them fixed right away. &nbsp;Good luck fixing your brakes. &nbsp;If there is anything else that you would like to add, please feel free to leave a comment below.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
