For a long time, you&#8217;d find it under the hood.&nbsp; It looked like a little pill, and it would be quick and easy to replace.&nbsp; This was in the era of carbureted vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>Things began to change in the 80&#8217;s.&nbsp; Fuel injection requires higher fuel pressure.&nbsp; Higher fuel pressure meant that a more robust fuel filter would be required.&nbsp; This meant the fuel filter was no longer left under the hood.&nbsp; It was put in the steel fuel line, between the gas tank and engine bay.<\/p>\n<p>These fuel filters were more reliable, but they also were tougher to change.&nbsp; Repairing them means getting under the vehicle and disconnecting steel fittings.&nbsp; It really still isn&#8217;t that difficult to deal with, as long as you give the vehicle a few minutes for the fuel pressure to go down.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is, no matter how old your Caravan is, the symptoms of a bad fuel filter are universal.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s in-tank or in-line. &nbsp;And, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=fuel+filter+Dodge+Caravan&amp;crid=3T94OXKHTCXPT&amp;sprefix=fuel+filter+Dodge+t,aps,224&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_20&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=fcfd795a365d927a221bce035d8b5f9a&amp;language=en_US\">fuel filters are cheap<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Signs of a Bad Fuel Filter: &nbsp;Dodge Caravan<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73692\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73692\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Fuel-Filter.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73692\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Fuel-Filter.jpg\" alt=\"Dodge Caravan Bad Fuel Filter Diagnosis\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Fuel-Filter.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Fuel-Filter-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-73692\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Typical Fuel Filter<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>There are physical signs that you can feel when your Caravan&#8217;s fuel filter is clogging.&nbsp; &nbsp;Before taking anything apart, check to see if your engines computer has any trouble codes saved in it.<\/p>\n<p>The engine may throw a P0087 trouble code.&nbsp; This trouble code detects that the fuel rail\/system pressure is too low.&nbsp; Any trouble codes that exist could be a clue.&nbsp; Sometimes when there is low fuel pressure, you may also get an oxygen sensor related trouble code as well.&nbsp; The real issue with diagnosing a bad fuel filter is that it resembles many other vehicular issues in terms of symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the most common symptoms of a bad fuel filter in your Dodge Caravan:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>&nbsp;Sputtering Under Load<\/h3>\n<p>The only way that you are going to know that your Caravan&#8217;s fuel filter may be going out is that it is no longer letting enough fuel through to keep the engine running under a heavy load, or at high-speed. &nbsp;Typically, if you are heading up a hill (or accelerating) the engine may start to feel like it is just running out of steam.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what it feels like with a bad fuel filter. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now, a bad fuel filter can also feel a heck of a lot like a bad catalytic converter.&nbsp; Both conditions will make the motor feel like it is running out of wind when you hit the gas. &nbsp;A bad catalytic converter will not feel as jarring.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a smooth lack of power.&nbsp; If you are unsure, check out this article on <a style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.dummies.com\/home-garden\/car-repair\/fuel-system\/how-to-troubleshoot-catalytic-converters\/\">troubleshooting catalytic converters<\/a><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">. &nbsp;If you get<a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0420-Dodge-Caravan\/\"> P0420<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0430-Dodge-Caravan\/\">P0430<\/a> trouble codes with a scanner, it very well may be the catalytic converter causing these symptoms.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Hard to Start Engine<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best indicators of a clogged fuel filter is going to be that the your Caravan is difficult to start.&nbsp; This because there&#8217;s not enough fuel pressure to properly atomize the fuel as it enters the combustion chamber.<\/p>\n<p>If your car is difficult to start, a clogged fuel filter would probably not be the place to start looking, especially if you are getting no trouble code for fuel pressure or the oxygen sensors.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, we&#8217;d recommend taking a look at the ignition system first.&nbsp; Often it&#8217;ll be <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-spark-plug-symptoms-Dodge-Caravan\/\">bad spark plugs<\/a>, or a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.carsdirect.com\/car-repair\/how-to-tell-if-you-have-a-faulty-coil-pack\">bad coil pack<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Engine Not Starting<\/h3>\n<p>If the fuel filter has become so contaminated that the minimum amount of fuel has not been let through it, the engine won&#8217;t start at all.<\/p>\n<p>At the most basic of levels your Dodge Caravan needs three things to start:&nbsp; Air, fuel, and spark.&nbsp; If any of these things aren&#8217;t present, the engine won&#8217;t turn over at all. &nbsp;If there&#8217;s been zero warning that the fuel filter could be going bad (hesitation, difficulty starting, etc) than a clogged fuel filter might not be the place to start.&nbsp; It could certainly cause the problem though.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a great video on using your eyes to diagnose the fuel filter:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Btz7edPELSc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>It Could Also be Your Caravan&#8217;s Fuel Pump<\/h2>\n<p>A fuel pump that is going out is going to feel the same as a bad fuel filter.&nbsp; This makes telling if you have a bad fuel pump vs bad fuel filter very challenging.<\/p>\n<p>How do you tell them apart?&nbsp; A clogged fuel filter will have high pressure on its input side and low pressure on its output side.&nbsp; They are both going to cause the same hesitation at high speed and difficulty starting.&nbsp; The only way to truly tell is to place a fuel pressure gauge on both sides of the line and get a reading from both.<\/p>\n<p>If your car isn&#8217;t starting at all, and you hear the fuel pump prime that is usually a good indication that the pump is working to some capacity. &nbsp;Testing your Caravan&#8217;s fuel pressure on each side of the pump would be the best way to diagnose this problem.<\/p>\n<p>A priming fuel pump sounds like a high-pitched whine for a few seconds and can be heard with a sharp engine right after the ignition key is turned, but before the starter is engaged.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Dodge Caravan Bad Fuel Pump<\/h2>\n<p>The symptoms of a bad fuel pump match a lot of other common problems that can occur in the Dodge Caravan. &nbsp;Testing the filter and pressure on each side of it are going to be the quickest ways to rule it out. &nbsp;If there is anything you would like to add, please leave a comment below. &nbsp;Good luck!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the worst problems that can happen to your Dodge Caravan is a bad fuel filter.&nbsp;
