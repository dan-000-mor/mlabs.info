&nbsp;Your cars A\/C system leaks water directly underneath the engine bay as it works. &nbsp;If you have a big puddle of water under your car it may be because it was left running in place for a while. &nbsp;Fifteen minutes on a hot day can be enough to get a trail to the rear wheels. &nbsp;This is completely normal and should not be cause for alarm.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Exhaust System<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;Your car&#8217;s engine creates steam as part of the combustion process. &nbsp;It is way more noticeable in the winter time when white smoke billows out of your exhaust pipe. &nbsp;Water can also leak out of the exhaust as this happens. &nbsp;A little water is completely normal. &nbsp;A lot of water leaking out of the tail pipe is certainly a cause for concern.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<h3>Some Water Under the Car Might be OK<\/h3>\n<p>Your car&#8217;s air conditioning system is going to produce water as a product of the cooling process. &nbsp;This is normal. &nbsp;It will usually produce moisture just behind the rear tires. &nbsp;This is harmless water, and is nothing to worry about.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Leaking Cooling System<\/h2>\n<p>If it&#8217;s coolant on the garage floor, and not leaking water, that&#8217;ll be an entirely different set of circumstances causing the leak.<\/p>\n<p>It is possible that your coolant system could be leaking water. &nbsp;If you, or whoever had the car before you filled the cooling system up with water instead of anti-freeze coolant, it could leak water. &nbsp;The problem is that water will freeze in the winter time and cause the engine block, heads, freeze plugs, or some other part of the engine to freeze up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Common Places Your Cooling System Leaks Water<\/h3>\n<p>If your cooling system is leaking water or coolant, here are the most common reasons that it may be doing so:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thermostat Housing<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;The thermostat is a small device that acts as a barrier that lets coolant into the engine only when it reaches a certain temperature (usually a bit over 200 degrees). &nbsp;There is a housing that bolts to the block that holds the thermostat. &nbsp;It&#8217;ll have a radiator hose attached to it. &nbsp;It is very common to find that the car is leaking water or (hopefully) coolant from this location. &nbsp;It&#8217;ll be toward the front of the vehicle, further up than where the A\/C condensation would be.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Radiator<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;A bad radiator can will cause antifreeze to leak onto your garage floor or driveway. &nbsp;If you go looking for it, just treat those electric fans like they can run at any time just to be safe.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Radiator Hose<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;There is a rubber hose that connects the radiator to the thermostat housing, and another one that connects the return from the engine block. &nbsp;These hoses can leak coolant from them as they dry out and crack.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Head Gasket<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;The head gasket is designed to fail before permanent damage is done to the block or head when overheating. &nbsp;This does not mean that the head gasket will only fail if the engine has overheated. &nbsp;If the head gasket is blown, it could let coolant out of the engine onto the ground. &nbsp;It could also let coolant into the exhaust, which would manifest itself as white smoke.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cracked Head or Block<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;This would be the last thing that you&#8217;d want to look at on this list, as it&#8217;s far more likely that one of four issues listed above would be causing water to leak from your car.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Car Leaking Water<\/h2>\n<p>Water itself, is often not a problem at all. &nbsp;If you have a coolant leak, that&#8217;s another thing entirely. &nbsp;Good luck diagnosing the water leak from your car.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If your car is leaking water, it can mean a few different things are happening. &nbsp;Some water is completely acceptable in some situations. &nbsp;It really depends on where you&#8217;ve found it, and if it&#8217;s actually water. &nbsp;
