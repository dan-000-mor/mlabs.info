So, unless you are looking at any big block other than the 400, you can rule out the C4.<\/p>\n<p>The speedometer cable is attached to the driver&#8217;s side tail shaft, if you are looking under the car, that is a good place to start. \u00a0The tail shaft or transfer case bolt to the C4 with six bolts.<\/p>\n<p>The most effective way to identify which three speed Ford automatic that you are looking at is to count the number of bolts used to secure the transmission pan. \u00a0They each use a different number, so there really is no confusion. \u00a0 <strong>There are 11 bolts on the C4<\/strong>. \u00a0Pan shape is more uniform than GM automatic transmissions, but they each do have a different shape.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-818\" src=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/C4-Transmission-Identification.jpg\" alt=\"C4 Identification\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/C4-Transmission-Identification.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/C4-Transmission-Identification-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/C4-Transmission-Identification-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/C4-Transmission-Identification-100x75.jpg 100w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/C4-Transmission-Identification-150x113.jpg 150w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/C4-Transmission-Identification-200x150.jpg 200w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/C4-Transmission-Identification-450x338.jpg 450w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/C4-Transmission-Identification-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/C4-Transmission-Identification-900x675.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As stated earlier, the 1960&#8217;s version of the transmission had a <strong>vent tube<\/strong> on the passenger side. \u00a0It was eliminated for the 1970 model year and never returned. \u00a0So if you see that tube, you can fairly assume that you have identified an early model.<\/p>\n<p>In the 1970 and later version it has something called a <strong>&#8220;jiggle pin&#8221;<\/strong>. \u00a0It stays on top of the housing by the tail shaft and\u00a0vents the case. \u00a0It is just a basic valve that pops open when the case gets enough pressure. \u00a0If you happen to be looking at a transmission without a tail shaft\/transfer case you can identify it as a C4 4&#215;4 transmission by the tube coming from where the jiggle pin normally would be. \u00a0Either way, if you see the jiggle pin you know you have found a 1970+ model.<\/p>\n<p>1973+ models have a push in modulator, whereas all the earlier ones screwed in. \u00a0The modulator is located on the back of the case above the pan.<\/p>\n<p>You can tell whether you have the weaker car line version of the C4 by looking at the bolts that fasten the bellhousing to the case. \u00a0If the bolts hold the pump and the housing than it probably came from a car. \u00a0The car versions also used a shallower pan until the late 70&#8217;s<\/p>\n<p>There are so many different versions of the C4. \u00a0There are over ten different bell housings depending on which one you are looking at you need to make sure that it is compatible with the engine that you would like to drop in. \u00a0They are removable though, so don&#8217;t sweat it too much, but it&#8217;ll give you a great idea where the transmission came from. \u00a0Here is a pretty good guide to figuring out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.com\/pin\/539939442804017129\/\">which bellhousing<\/a> is currently on your C4.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/D-Rzq5WO-MA?ecver=1\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h1>Conclusion<\/h1>\n<p>The C4 transmission is still a great transmission to use for your hot rod, bracket racer. \u00a0Finding them at swap meets isn&#8217;t very hard. \u00a0Keep your eyes peeled and you&#8217;ll find one on craigslist for under $200. \u00a0As long as you feel like you don&#8217;t need overdrive you can&#8217;t go wrong with it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
