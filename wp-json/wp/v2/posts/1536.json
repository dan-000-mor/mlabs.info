<strong>GMC Acadia<\/strong> has been in production for over 12 years now. \u00a0The first generation was a full size SUV and ran from 2007-2016. \u00a0The second generation of the Acadia has been in production for a few years now. \u00a0that&#8217;s long enough for there to be quite a few older models with <strong>transmission problems<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>There are two main sections to this article. \u00a0There&#8217;s:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"#Acadia Specific Transmission Problems\">Acadia Specific Transmission Problems<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"#General Transmission Problems + Diagnosis\">General Transmission Problems + Diagnosis<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The Acadia specific section deals with recalls and TSB&#8217;s (Technical Service Bulletins). \u00a0The general problem section deals with common Acadia problems with an emphasis on the 6T75 and 6T70&#8217;s (these are the transmissions they come with) most common areas of weakness.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes a bad shifter will lead to a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gmc-acadia-backup-camera-not-working\/\">GMC Acadia Backup Camera Not Working<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>What transmission is my Acadia?<\/h3>\n<p>The transmissions used in all Acadia&#8217;s have been:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>2007-2016: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <strong>6T75<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>2017-Present: \u00a0 <strong>6T70<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The 6T75 and 6T70 were both transversely mounted 6 speed automatic transmissions. \u00a0Like all modern GM transmissions, they are controlled by electronic means. \u00a0They don&#8217;t have an E on the end like other GM automatics because they never really existed in a time when transmissions weren&#8217;t controlled this way.<\/p>\n<p>These transmissions are the product of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theautochannel.com\/news\/2005\/08\/25\/141299.html\">joint venture<\/a> between Ford Motor Company and General Motors. \u00a0Some of the earlier models did have some inherent weakness that would cause them to fail prematurely. \u00a0There&#8217;s more on that below.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3 id=\"Acadia Specific Transmission Problems\">Acadia Transmission Recalls+ Technical Service Bulletins<\/h3>\n<p>There have been a few transmission recalls on the GMC Acadia. \u00a0They are listed below. \u00a0Both of them involve the shift linkage coming out of adjustment. \u00a0This leads to potential roll away situations. \u00a0The affected years are 2014 and 2009.<\/p>\n<p>Technical service bulletins (TSB&#8217;s) are an acknowledgment of a common problem by the manufacturer. \u00a0They are sent out to all of the authorized dealers for the vehicle and are a great source of knowledge when trying to troubleshoot an Acadia&#8217;s transmission.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"h1 large-h1 font-white body-bold\">2014 Acadia: \u00a0Recall 14V092000<\/h4>\n<p>The Acadia was recalled for an issue with the transmission shift cable adjuster well&#8230; getting out of adjustment. \u00a0The dealer is required to inspect and replace when appropriate the shift cable adjuster on all 2014 models.<\/p>\n<p>If left unchecked, eventually the shifter indicator will no longer be accurate. \u00a0Eventually, the transmission may even lose the ability to go into park at all. \u00a0But, the gear selector will still slide into the park position, which makes the 2014 Acadia a roll away hazard.<\/p>\n<p>The General Motors recall number for this problem is <strong>14048<\/strong>. \u00a0Go ahead and give your GM dealer a call and see if this has been performed on your particular Acadia. \u00a0With the VIN number and that recall number, you&#8217;ll be able to schedule the free repair.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>2013 Acadia: \u00a0TSB 13120A<\/h4>\n<p>Some 2013 Acadia&#8217;s may have a problem with the torque converter staying locked. \u00a0When the vehicle comes to a stop this causes the engine to die, much like rolling to a stop in a manual transmission vehicle would. \u00a0When the torque converter is locked, there is a true 1:1 connection between the motor and the rest of the driveline. \u00a0This means that the torque converter can&#8217;t slip, which in turn means that the engine cannot idle at all.<\/p>\n<p>This is a problem with the TCM, which is the computer that controls the transmission. \u00a0You&#8217;ll need to have it re-flashed. \u00a0Your local GM dealer can do that for you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>2009 Acadia: \u00a0Recall 09V073000<\/h4>\n<p>This is another one year only recall. \u00a0It is for an issue similar to the one listed above. \u00a0In this one, the 2009 Acadia shift adjustment cable may get loose. \u00a0Once it gets loose the shift indicator may show that it is in park when it&#8217;s in one of the moving gears or in reverse. \u00a0This means that any 2009 Acadia that has not had this recall performed is a potential roll away risk.<\/p>\n<p>Being that the 2009 Acadia is about a 10 year old vehicle, this recall may very well have already been performed on your particular vehicle. \u00a0It&#8217;s still worth giving GM a call and seeing if it has been performed.<\/p>\n<p>The recall number is\u00a0<strong>09041<\/strong>. \u00a0You can give GM that number and you VIN and they&#8217;ll be able to tell if it has come in for that recall or not. \u00a0In the meantime, you would be wise to set the parking brake when you park. \u00a0It&#8217;s better for the transmission to do that anyway.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>2009 Acadia: \u00a0TSB PIP4668<\/h4>\n<p>This is one of the stranger TSB&#8217;s on this list. \u00a0That&#8217;s because it covers a wide range of symptoms. \u00a0The reason why it is such an eclectic list is because the problems are caused by the TCM and not any physical part going bad. \u00a0If you are experiencing any of these issues, it may be time to take your Acadia into the dealer and have the computer re-flashed.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Poor shift feel<\/li>\n<li>Hesitation when turning right (not left)<\/li>\n<li>Hesitation during the 2-3 shift, but only under light throttle<\/li>\n<li>Nonlinear deceleration\/tachometer swing on 5-4 down shift and coast<\/li>\n<li>Cruise control &#8220;busyness&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Basically, if you have a 2009 Acadia, and the transmission is acting like it is possessed, go ahead and bring it in to have it re-flashed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>2007 Acadia: \u00a0TSB 09-07-30-012B<\/h4>\n<p>This Technical Service Bulletin covers a wide range of problem that are caused by a faulty 3-5-R clutch wave plate. \u00a0The problems associated with this plate going bad include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>No Reverse<\/li>\n<li>Harsh shifts in 3&#8217;rd and 5&#8217;th gear<\/li>\n<li>Slipping transmission in-between shifts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When this plate goes bad, it allows the piston to leak and not properly apply the gears. \u00a0And since this plate covers 3&#8217;rd, 5&#8217;th, and reverse only those gears are affected. \u00a0You&#8217;ll also get a service engine soon light for this particular issue.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"General Transmission Problems + Diagnosis\">Troubleshooting Common GMC Acadia Transmission Problems<\/h3>\n<p>There have been a few Acadia transmission recalls over the years, and quite a few Technical Service Bulletins. \u00a0The TSB&#8217;s and recalls are a great way to figure out what transmission problems that the GMC Acadia might be having. \u00a0That&#8217;s because they are the problems that are so prevalent that the manufacturer needed to make the information public. \u00a0That&#8217;s always the best place to start your diagnosis.<\/p>\n<p>If you have looked through the bulletins listed above and still haven&#8217;t quite found what you were looking for, we&#8217;ll cover some of the most common 4T70 + 4T75 transmission problems right here.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Overheating<\/h4>\n<p>The 6T70 is know to overheat. \u00a0This is typically caused by a faulty circuit, and not an actual problem with the radiator\/cooling system.<\/p>\n<h4>Slipping Gears<\/h4>\n<p>There are TSB&#8217;s listed above that do cover slipping gears, but other issues can still cause slipping. \u00a0All transmissions wear out eventually. \u00a0The Acadia transmissions are no different. \u00a0The problem is usually caused by a bad planetary gear or a bad solenoid.<\/p>\n<h4>No Reverse<\/h4>\n<p>This happens quite a bit and is caused by a bad solenoid.<\/p>\n<h4>Transmission Won&#8217;t Shift<\/h4>\n<p>Often the transmissions in the Acadia will stop shifting. \u00a0This is caused by a bad torque converter or brake switch.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>Most of the common problems that occur with the GMC Acadia&#8217;s transmission are related to electronics and how they are controlled. \u00a0The one nice thing about that is the dealer can fix it by hooking in a laptop a lot of the time. \u00a0Good luck with your particular Acadia!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
