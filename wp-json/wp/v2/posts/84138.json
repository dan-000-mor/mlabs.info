&nbsp;Most of the time, black smoke indicates that the air\/fuel mixture is &#8220;rich&#8221;. &nbsp;A rich condition means that there is not enough air in relation to the amount of fuel. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Before even so much as opening the hood, we recommend checking the engine trouble codes if there are any. &nbsp;If the check engine light is on, there will be some stored in your Cavalier&#8217;s computer. &nbsp;These codes can provide valuable clues as to what is going on with your Cavalier&#8217;s engine.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the most common causes of black smoke in your Cavalier:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Air Filter<\/h3>\n<p>One of the most commonly overlooked automotive maintenance items is the air filter. &nbsp;If the air filter is ignored long enough it will eventually clog to the point that not enough air is getting into the combustion chamber.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We always recommend taking a look at their filter first. &nbsp;They are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=air+filter+Chevy+Cavalier&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=a2d47b33c467e3efc0e35dd5d4b76cb0&amp;language=en_US\">really cheap<\/a>, easy to replace, and often fix the black smoke problem.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>EGR Valve<\/h3>\n<p>The EGR valve recycles exhaust smoke back into the combustion chamber to help reduce engine emissions. &nbsp;When the EGR valve goes bad these gasses have nowhere to go but out through the exhaust, and they appear as black smoke.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Bad Piston Rings&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<p>Piston rings are a series of rings that create extremely tight clearances between the piston and the cylinder wall. &nbsp;These rings keep oil from getting into the combustion chamber. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When they fail, your Cavalier will emit black smoke from the exhaust as oil is burnt along with the air and fuel in the cylinder.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Bad Fuel Injector(s)<\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_83918\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83918\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a

chamber.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Your Cavalier&#8217;s fuel injectors use high fuel pressure to atomize the fuel into a fine mist. &nbsp;This mist is the most combustible way to burn gasoline.<\/p>\n<p>Injectors can go bad in a few different ways. &nbsp;They can become clogged, open or close on time, or they may not have enough fuel pressure going to them. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s more on this: &nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-fuel-injector-symptoms-Chevy-Cavalier\/\">Chevy Cavalier: Bad Fuel Injector Diagnosis<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Mass Airflow Sensor<\/h3>\n<p>The mass airflow sensor measures the amount of air passing to the intake manifold. &nbsp;This is one of your Cavalier&#8217;s most vital sensors. &nbsp;When it is faulty, it can lead to changes to the air\/fuel mixture and make your Cavalier run rich. &nbsp;Black exhaust color is also common. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s more on <a
