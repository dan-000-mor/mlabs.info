Here&#8217;s how to narrow down what is wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pull the Diagnostic Codes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Use a scanner to pull up the diagnostic codes stored in your Saturn SC&#8217;s PCM.  As you&#8217;ll see below, many potential causes can put a vehicle into Engine Power Reduced mode.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you pull the code(s), you&#8217;ll want to focus on what causes that specific code, as &#8220;Engine Power Reduced&#8221; will be a symptom of that code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Technical Service Bulletins<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can head over to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nhtsa.gov\/recalls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NHTSA website<\/a> (it&#8217;ll open in a new tab) and look up the TSBs yourself.  You need to input your SC&#8217;s model year or use a VIN search.  Once you do, you&#8217;ll want to click on manufacturer communications.  It&#8217;ll have every TSB that Saturn produced for that model year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might get lucky and find a TSB that outlines a common reason why the Engine Power Reduced mode has come on, as well as a detailed repair guide.  Finding the right TSB may take some digging, but it&#8217;ll be worth it in the amount of work you save yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should cross-reference the TSB with the codes you pulled with your scanner.  If TSB and pulled code(s) seem to agree on the problem, following the TSB&#8217;s repair instructions would be your best course of action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Screen-Shot-2022-06-27-at-9.49.05-AM.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"461\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Screen-Shot-2022-06-27-at-9.49.05-AM-1024x461.jpg\" alt=\"SC Reduced Engine Power Fix\" class=\"wp-image-260920\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Screen-Shot-2022-06-27-at-9.49.05-AM-1024x461.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Screen-Shot-2022-06-27-at-9.49.05-AM-300x135.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Screen-Shot-2022-06-27-at-9.49.05-AM-768x346.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Screen-Shot-2022-06-27-at-9.49.05-AM.jpg 1532w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption>Once you put in your VIN or Make\/Model, this is where you&#8217;ll find the TSBs<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Saturn SC: Reduced Engine Power Causes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As stated above, <strong>following the codes is the best way to fix the Engine Power Reduced warning<\/strong> in the Saturn SC.  But, here are some of the most common reasons the code comes on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Throttle Actuator Control (TAC)<\/strong>&#8211; The TAC module and control motor work together to open the throttle on drive-by-wire (computer-controlled) systems.  When the signal from this system is not what it&#8217;s supposed to be, the PCM will reduce (or eliminate) the engine power.  <\/li><li><strong>Throttle\/Peddle Position Sensor<\/strong>&#8211; The pedal position sensor tells the PCM how far down you&#8217;ve pushed the throttle.  If it&#8217;s getting an unreliable signal from one of its circuits, reduced engine power will turn on.<\/li><li><strong>Idle Position Not Learned<\/strong>&#8211; This&#8217;ll usually be accompanied by P2176.<\/li><li><strong>MAP Sensor Issues<\/strong>&#8211; The Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor calculates the density of the air entering your SC&#8217;s engine.  Without an accurate reading, the engine power may be reduced.   You may have a code, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0108-Saturn-SC\/\">P0108<\/a>.<\/li><li><strong>Dirty Throttle Body<\/strong>&#8211; A dirty throttle body is known to cause reduced engine power.  Often, when the throttle body is dirty, the engine will have a hard time finding the proper idle speed after the vehicle slows down.  There will be a temporary drop in RPM <strong>below<\/strong> the normal idle speed before the PCM compensates for it.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"GM Reduced Engine Power Mystery Solved\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/C5BEPmFB6cw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Engine Power Reduced is GM&#8217;s way of keeping your Saturn SC safe when vital systems are no longer performing reliably.
