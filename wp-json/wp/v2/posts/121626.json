Power Steering Hose<\/h3>\n<p>The first thing that you would want to do is look around the power steering hoses for any obvious signs of a leak. &nbsp;The power steering hose will run from the pump to the rack or gear. &nbsp;The most common place that the hose will leak from where the metal part of the hose meets the rubber. &nbsp;Look for power steering fluid on or below it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. Power Steering Pump<\/h3>\n<p>Your FJ Cruiser&#8217;s power steering pump pushes the hydraulic fluid through power steering hoses and through the steering rack or gearbox. &nbsp;It is turned by the <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-FJ Cruiser-bad-serpentine-belt\/\">serpentine belt<\/a> attached to the engine. &nbsp;The pump can wear down over time. &nbsp;When it does it can begin to leak power steering fluid under the engine.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. Rack or Gearbox<\/h3>\n<p>There are seals in the rack or gear box that can go bad over time and leak.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. Cooler<\/h3>\n<p>On some makes and models there will be a power steering cooler. &nbsp;It&#8217;s easy to determine if there is a cooler. &nbsp;You&#8217;ll see lines running from the power steering pump to the radiator. &nbsp;It will look like a smaller radiator.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>FJ Cruiser Power Steering Fluid Leak Fix<\/h2>\n<p>Fixing the power steering fluid leak in your FJ Cruiser is a pretty straight forward process. &nbsp;You&#8217;ll want to try and find the leak. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, take a look at the power steering lines, they most commonly leak where the metal meets the rubber on the line. &nbsp;Replacing the line will stop the leak. &nbsp;If you have a power steering cooler, you&#8217;d want to follow the lines there as well. &nbsp;Hoses are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=power+steering+hose+FJ Cruiser&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=f932f8b3739cabd2c71efbb0cb42ead0&amp;language=en_US\">cheap<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>After that, the power steering pump itself would what you would want to take a look at. &nbsp;A leaking power steering pump is easy to identify. &nbsp;Unless it&#8217;s leaking from the very bottom, it&#8217;ll be covered in fluid.<\/li>\n<li>Seals in the rack and pinions or steering gear box can and do go bad over time. &nbsp;The leak should leave fluid further back than the power steering pump. &nbsp;This is the last thing that you would want to look at in terms of likelihood of it being the problem, as well as cost\/effort to fix.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Good luck finding your Toyota FJ Cruiser&#8217;s power steering fluid leak. &nbsp;If there is anything that you would like to add, please feel free to leave a comment below.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; One of the most common problems that happens with a vehicle over time is it&#8217;ll begin&nbsp;leaking power steering fluid. &nbsp;Your Toyota FJ Cruiser&#8216;s power steering fluid runs through your power steering pump, and all throughout the steering system. &nbsp; Without the power steering system, your FJ Cruiser would be very difficult to drive. &nbsp;Most &#8230; <a title=\"Toyota FJ Cruiser: &nbsp;Leaking Power Steering Fluid Causes\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/toyota-fj-cruiser-power-steering-fluid-leak\/\" aria-label=\"More on Toyota FJ Cruiser: &nbsp;Leaking Power Steering Fluid Causes\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[249],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/121626"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=121626"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/121626\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=121626"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=121626"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=121626"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
