or &#8220;creamy&#8221; in your radiator, or on your oil fill cap.<\/p>\n<p>If enough coolant gets into your oil pan, you may start to notice knocking and pinging sounds. &nbsp;This indicates that your oil is losing its viscosity. &nbsp;If left unattended for long enough, and enough water gets in, your Camry&#8217;s engine can lock up.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t take a lot of coolant to make the oil look milky. &nbsp;You may still have some in the reservoir.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Oil in Coolant Causes: &nbsp;Toyota Camry<\/h2>\n<p>There are only a few reasons that oil would be in your Camry&#8217;s coolant. &nbsp;While a failure of the head gasket is the most common reason, there are a few other reasons as well.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Blown Head Gasket<\/h3>\n<p>Far and away, the most common reason that you would find water in your coolant is a blown head gasket. &nbsp;A head gasket is supposed to have a lower failure temperature than a cylinder head. &nbsp;When it fails, it is protecting your Camry from even worse damage by relieving the pressure on the head before it can crack.<\/p>\n<p>A head gasket will fail when your cooling system can no longer keep it cool. &nbsp;Common reasons that the cooling system fails are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Camry-leaking-water\/\">Coolant Leak<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Camry-bad-thermostat-symptoms\/\">Bad Thermostat<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Bad Water Pump<\/li>\n<li>Defective<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Cracked Cylinder Head<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Oil-in-Coolant-Causes.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-117119\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Oil-in-Coolant-Causes.jpg\" alt=\"Toyota Camry Oil in Coolant Causes\" width=\"300\" height=\"101\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Outside of a failed head gasket, the most common reason that you would find oil in your water is going to be a cracked cylinder head. &nbsp;The most common way that a cylinder head cracks is by overheating. &nbsp;Either the head gasket failed to protect it by blowing first, or it got so hot that it blew anyway.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Bad Transmission Cooler<\/h3>\n<p>All radiators cool then engine coolant. &nbsp;But, if you have a regular automatic transmission the radiator will also cool the transmission fluid. &nbsp;That means that what you check the radiator, you may see what appears to be oil, but is actually transmission fluid. &nbsp;When this happens, a new radiator and a flush of the symptom will keep oil out of your Camry&#8217;s coolant.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Oil in Coolant Diagnosis: &nbsp;Toyota Camry<\/h2>\n<p>With your Camry parked, take the oil fill cap off. &nbsp;If you see what looks like a &#8220;milky&#8221; substance on top of the radiator cap, that&#8217;s a solid indication that the head gasket is blown or the head is cracked (much more likely the head gasket).<\/p>\n<p>If you do see the milky substance on the oil cap, see if you can shine a light down into the valve cover and see if you can see any further milky substance. &nbsp;You want to do this second confirmation so that you don&#8217;t end up taking half your engine apart chasing the wrong problem. &nbsp;Milky substance can appear on top of the oil cap if the car is not driven often, and not driven for long distances.<\/p>\n<p>If you do have a blown head gasket, you may experience <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/white-smoke-from-exhaust-Toyota-Camry\/\">white smoke<\/a> coming from your Camry&#8217;s exhaust system. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Camry Oil in Coolant<\/h2>\n<p>If you have oil in your Toyota Camry&#8217;s coolant, it is a serious problem that needs to be tracked down before there is any engine damage. &nbsp;Please leave a comment below if there is anything that you would like to add. &nbsp;Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;ve recently checked your Toyota Camry&#8217;s coolant, and it looks almost like it has butter in it, then you probably have oil in it. &nbsp;Oil in your coolant is most often caused by a blown head gasket.
