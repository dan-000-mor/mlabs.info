More often than not, your engines computer will be able to detect bad Coil Packs in your Insignia.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There are several misfire related trouble codes.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0300-Opel-Insignia\/\">P0300<\/a>&#8211; &nbsp;this trouble code indicates that there is a random misfire. A random misfire means is that a misfire is detected, but the ECM is not able to determine which one it is coming from, or the misfire is occurring randomly.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0301-Opel-Insignia\/\">P0301<\/a> through P0312- &nbsp;these trouble codes indicate that there is a misfire in one specific cylinder. &nbsp;For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0304-Opel-Insignia\/\">P0304<\/a> is for a misfire in cylinder 4 <strong>in the firing order<\/strong>. &nbsp;This makes diagnosing the misfire a bit more straightforward.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are other misfire related codes as well.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Coil-Pack-Symptoms.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-76510\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Coil-Pack-Symptoms.png\" alt=\"Opel Insignia Bad Coil Pack Symptoms\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Coil-Pack-Symptoms.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Coil-Pack-Symptoms-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2. &nbsp;Acceleration isn&#8217;t Normal<\/h3>\n<p>As you hit your Insignia&#8217;s gas pedal, the fuel and ignition systems respond. &nbsp;If acceleration has diminished, it should be felt. &nbsp;The less cylinders that your engine has, the more that one cylinder not firing properly will have an effect on engine performance.<\/p>\n<p>If you have one or more bad Coil Packs, it&#8217;ll cause the acceleration of the Insignia to be weaker, and you&#8217;ll probably feel a jerking sensation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. &nbsp;Fuel Economy<\/h3>\n<p>The less efficient the combustion of your engine, the more fuel is going to be wasted. &nbsp;This leads to a decrease in fuel economy. &nbsp;When you take your vehicle in for a tune up due to decreased fuel economy, checking the ignition system in general (including the coil packs) is going to be one of the very first places that a mechanic is going to look at.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. &nbsp;Misfire<\/h3>\n<p>Misfiring is the most common symptom of bad Coil Packs. Anything else that you may feel is a result of the misfiring itself. &nbsp;The real question is, what is causing the misfire? &nbsp;There is more to your Insignia&#8217;s ignition system than just the coil packs. &nbsp;There&#8217;s also spark plugs and plug wires.<\/p>\n<p>There are also non ignition related circumstances that can cause a misfire. &nbsp;That would include lack of fuel pressure, bad fuel injectors, or even a timing chain (or belt) that has <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/timing-chain-jumped-symptoms-and-diagnosis\/\">jumped<\/a>. &nbsp;Since there are so many reasons that a vehicle can misfire, we recommend testing for trouble codes first.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>5. &nbsp;Rough Idling<\/h3>\n<p>When a Spark Plug is misfiring, it is often most pronounced at idle speed. &nbsp;This is because when the engine turns slower, it is easier to detect. &nbsp;You&#8217;ll feel a rough vibration.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Bad Coil Packs Opel Insignia<\/h2>\n<p>Be aware that almost all symptoms of a bad coil pack in your Insignia could also be other issues with the ignition system as well. &nbsp;Good luck diagnosing the problem! &nbsp;Feel free to leave a comment below if there is anything that you would like to add.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Bad Coil Packs are one of the more problematic ignition issues that can occur with the&nbsp;Opel Insignia. &nbsp;A bad oil pack can make your Insignia almost un-drivable. &nbsp;Or it may have little effect at all on the engine&#8217;s ability to run. &nbsp;It&#8217;ll get worse as they lose their ability to fire the spark plugs. &#8230; <a title=\"Opel Insignia: Bad Coil Packs \u2192 Symptoms and Diagnosis\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-coil-pack-symptoms-opel-insignia\/\" aria-label=\"More on Opel Insignia: Bad Coil Packs \u2192 Symptoms and Diagnosis\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[410],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/77129"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=77129"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/77129\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=77129"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=77129"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=77129"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
