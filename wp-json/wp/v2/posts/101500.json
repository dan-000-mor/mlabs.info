The power steering system is responsible for taking energy from the engine and using it to decrease the amount of force that you need to use to move the car. &nbsp;It achieves this by using hydraulic pressure created by the power steering pump.<\/p>\n<p>Before power steering, it would take many turns of the steering wheel to move the wheels all the way in any direction. &nbsp;Many turns made it easier for the driver to move the wheels, but it was still much harder than driving a non power assisted vehicle. &nbsp;Since now you only get a few turns of the wheel, it can be almost impossible to drive a modern car without power steering.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Steering-Wheel-Hard-to-Turn.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-101503\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Steering-Wheel-Hard-to-Turn.jpg\" alt=\"Steering Wheel Hard to Turn\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Steering Wheel Hard to Turn Causes<\/h2>\n<p>Here are five of the most common reasons why your steering wheel may be hard to turn. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>1. &nbsp;Power Steering Fluid Low<\/h3>\n<p>The place to start looking for what is making your steering wheel hard to turn is the power steering fluid. &nbsp;If enough of it has leaked out, the vehicle will no longer have enough to properly function. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is the most common reason that the power steering stops working. &nbsp;Putting fluid back in may solve the problem for a bit, but if has leaked out before, it will leak out again. &nbsp;Finding the cause of the leak is going to be necessary. &nbsp;Check the hoses around the pump. &nbsp;That&#8217;s the place they most often leak from.<\/p>\n<p>You should have been hearing an almost grumble like sound as you moved the wheel if this were the case. &nbsp;It won&#8217;t grumble or wine if ALL the fluid is out though.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. &nbsp;Bad Power Steering Pump<\/h3>\n<p>The power steering pump itself can go bad. &nbsp;If it is no longer pumping fluid, it can&#8217;t pressurize the power steering lines and there will be no steering assistance.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. &nbsp;Loose or Bad Belt<\/h3>\n<p>You can check the belt that turns the power steering pump. &nbsp;Does it look worn or damaged to you? &nbsp;Is it shiny and glazed? &nbsp;With the engine off, pinch it lightly and try and move your fingers. &nbsp;If doesn&#8217;t grip them at all, that could be a sign of a bad belt. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. &nbsp;Rack Issues<\/h3>\n<p>The rack is what takes the pressure from the power steering system and actually applies it to the wheels. &nbsp;If it is the rack that is causing the problem, it&#8217;s typically going to manifest itself more when the vehicle is cold. &nbsp;As it warms up the problem will go away (at first). &nbsp;Eventually it never goes away.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>5. &nbsp;Bad Fluid<\/h3>\n<p>It is possible that the power steering fluid has gotten so thick over time that it is no longer properly doing it&#8217;s job as a hydraulic fluid. &nbsp;If this is the case, you&#8217;ll need to flush the power steering fluid. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Steering Wheel Hard to Steer<\/h2>\n<p>If your having a hard time steering your vehicle, it is a safety issue. &nbsp;We recommend bringing it in for service right away. &nbsp;If it was out of fluid, make sure to keep an eye on it. &nbsp;You don&#8217;t want to run out again and burn up the pump. &nbsp;Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If your vehicle has a steering wheel that is hard to turn, it&#8217;s almost always going to be caused by an issue with the power steering system itself.
