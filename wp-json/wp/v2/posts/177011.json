There are a few reasons why your Toyota Tacoma may not be starting, such as a bad starter, a bad battery, bad alternator, and more.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Toyota Tacoma Hesitates to Start: Causes<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some of the most typical reasons your Tacoma&#8217;s starter is not cranking as fast as it should be.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Bad Battery.<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/How-to-Start-Car-in-Cold-Weather.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-103699\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/How-to-Start-Car-in-Cold-Weather.jpg\" alt=\"Toyota Tacoma Hesitates to Start\" width=\"500\" height=\"296\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The battery is responsible for providing the voltage necessary to crank your Tacoma&#8217;s engine over when it is not running. When the battery begins to give out, it will provide enough voltage for a start, but not enough for a quick start. You can almost FEEL it struggling to turn the engine when this happens.<\/p>\n<p>As the battery ages its ability to provide what&#8217;s called &#8220;cranking amps &#8220;diminishes. It is most noticeable when it is cold outside.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Tacoma-battery-light\/\">battery light<\/a> is a good indication that you were going down the right path with your diagnosis, but it is not guaranteed that the battery is good if it is not on.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. Corroded Battery Post<\/h3>\n<p>A corroded battery post can easily create a condition where your Tacoma hesitates to start. It also happens to be the easiest thing to check on this list.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind take a look real quick and see if there&#8217;s any corrosion or battery acid on the battery cables or post. If there is, you&#8217;ll need to scrape it off. You can get a wire brush at Walmart, or you can purchase a dedicated battery post cleaner. Make sure to wear some protection over your eyes. &nbsp;Battery acid is corrosive and stings.<\/p>\n<p>A bad battery cable can also have the same exact affect. The way that you tell that the battery cable is bad is to check the voltage as it leaves the alternator, and check it again as it enters the battery. &nbsp;There&#8217;s a video below that goes into all of this in great detail.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure that the battery posts are tightened all the way too&#8230;..<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. Bad Alternator<\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_74394\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74394\" style=\"width: 390px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Alternator-Symptoms.jpeg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-74394\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Alternator-Symptoms-916x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"447\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Alternator-Symptoms-916x1024.jpeg 916w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Alternator-Symptoms-268x300.jpeg 268w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Alternator-Symptoms-768x859.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Alternator-Symptoms.jpeg 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-74394\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A typical alternator<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-alternator-symptoms-Toyota-Tacoma\/\">bad alternator<\/a> can also cause your Tacoma to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/vehicle-hesitates-to-start\/\">hesitate when starting<\/a>. If it&#8217;s not charging the battery all the way, it will exist in this limbo where it&#8217;s doing the job good enough but not great.<\/p>\n<p>He can have an auto parts store test your alternator. &nbsp;Most of them have a machine that will spin it fast enough to tell what kind of voltage is coming from it. But, that involves removing the alternator from the vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>You can test the alternator yourself pretty easy with a multimeter. Before you start the vehicle, hook a multimeter to the battery. Get the voltage number, now go ahead and start it and test it again. If it&#8217;s under 13.0 V with the vehicle started, the alternator is probably bad.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a very abbreviated version of something that&#8217;s explained much better in this video:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ab5Kk6JkbsI\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3>4. Bad Starter<\/h3>\n<p>Your Tacoma may be turning over slowly due to a <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Tacoma-bad-starter\/\">worn starter motor<\/a>. &nbsp;When you turn the key, a powerful electromagnet is activated that forces the starter gear to engage. Once this happens, the starter turns the flywheel fast enough fast enough that the engine can take over.<\/p>\n<p>Your vehicle&#8217;s starter is really a powerful electric motor. As it wears out, I won&#8217;t be able to spin fast enough anymore, and your vehicle will hesitate to start.<\/p>\n<p>It is also possible that the electrical contacts going to it are damaged or corroded.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Toyota Tacoma Hesitates to Start When Cold<\/h2>\n<p>If your Tacoma is hesitating to start when cold, it&#8217;s usually due to the battery struggling to provide enough cold cranking amperage. &nbsp;Batteries have two amperage ratings. &nbsp;The first is cranking amps, and the second as cold cranking amperage (CCA).<\/p>\n<p>When the weather is nice outside the battery is able to provide it&#8217;s full cranking amperage. &nbsp;CCA is the number of amps that a battery can provide to the starter at 0\u00b0F for 30 seconds while maintaining 7.2 V plus. &nbsp;CCA is always a lower number.<\/p>\n<p>Your Tacoma is designed to be able to start just fine with the advertised amount of cold cranking amperage. As a battery ages its ability to provide cranking amperage diminishes. &nbsp;In the summer this can go unnoticed, as the number of amps is above the CCA amperage &nbsp;But, in the winter time it&#8217;ll become a lot more obvious and a vehicle hesitate to start as the cold cranking amperage is too low.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an in-depth guide to why your <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Tacoma-wont-start-cold\/\">Tacoma isn&#8217;t starting when cold<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>This is not a definitive list of why a Toyota Tacoma may hesitate to start, but it does cover all the most common reasons. &nbsp;Good luck!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While it may not leave you stranded, a vehicle that hesitates to start can be very concerning.
