They are often covered with a small protective boot. &nbsp;If that boot fails, they can dry up and will stop moving freely.<\/p>\n<p>When guide pins fail, they cause the brake pads to make uneven contact with the rotors. &nbsp;They can also make the caliper stick, which can burn up the brakes fast. &nbsp;This will cause your Echo to have <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Echo-squeaky-brakes\/\">squeaky brakes<\/a>. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The extreme heat will also cause the pads to &#8220;glaze&#8221;. &nbsp;This hardening of the brakes will increase the distance needed to stop the vehicle. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Between the potential for the brake pads to hit the rotor at the wrong angle, glazing, and potential stuck calipers, dry guide pins can definitely cause your steering wheel to vibrate when you push the brakes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. &nbsp;Rotors<\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_68553\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68553\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Shaking-When-Braking-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-68553 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Shaking-When-Braking-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"Toyota Echo Shaking when Braking\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Shaking-When-Braking-Diagnosis.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Shaking-When-Braking-Diagnosis-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-68553\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rotors are often what cause of a shaking vehicle<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The number one reason that your Echo&#8217;s steering wheel will shake is warped brake rotors. &nbsp;Rotors can warp if they&#8217;ve been worn too low, or worn unevenly. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Warped rotors are even more common today than they used to be. &nbsp;This is because auto manufacturers are constantly trying to reduce <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cjponyparts.com\/resources\/what-is-unsprung-weight\">unsprung weight<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If the surface of the rotor is not smooth, you&#8217;ll need to either have them resurfaced, or buy new ones. &nbsp;A visual inspection will often reveal grooves and unevenness even to the untrained eye.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. &nbsp;Brake Pads<\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_68554\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68554\" style=\"width: 215px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Steering-Wheel-Vibrates-When-Braking.jpeg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-68554 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Steering-Wheel-Vibrates-When-Braking-225x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Toyota Echo Steering Wheel Vibrates When Braking\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Steering-Wheel-Vibrates-When-Braking-225x300.jpeg 225w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Steering-Wheel-Vibrates-When-Braking-768x1024.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-68554\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">&nbsp;<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>When the brake pads are operating normally, a pad that is not worn out or dirty is making even contact with the rotor. &nbsp;It distributes the pressure evenly and your Echo&#8217;s steering wheel will not shake. &nbsp;The Echo will come to a stop noise free.<\/p>\n<p>If the brake pads are worn past their useful life, or if they are dirty, they will no longer be able to make the quality contact with your steering wheel. &nbsp;At this point, you&#8217;ll feel your steering wheel shake as the brakes are pressed down.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Toyota Echo Shakes When Braking<\/h2>\n<p>It is advisable to have your brakes repaired as soon as possible. &nbsp;Warped rotors, dry guide pins, and bad brake pads can all increase your Toyota Echo&#8217;s stopping distance. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This, is dangerous in itself. &nbsp;Good luck diagnosing your shaking steering wheel when braking. &nbsp;Please leave a comment below if there is anything that you would like to add.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
