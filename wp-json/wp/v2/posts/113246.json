Toyota Hilux<\/h2>\n<p>Here are the most common symptoms of a bad throttle body in your Hilux.&nbsp; The problem with almost all of the noticeable symptoms are that they can also indicate problems other than the throttle body as well.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why we strongly recommend that you start with the <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Hilux-service-engine-soon\/\">check engine light<\/a>, if it happens to be on.&nbsp; It can tell you a lot about what is going on.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Service Engine Soon Light<\/h3>\n<p>The check engine light is one of the most common symptoms of a bad throttle body in your Hilux.&nbsp; The check engine light itself being on is not a bad thing.&nbsp; The trouble codes that are stored in the computer can tell a lot about what is actually going on.&nbsp; This makes diagnosing the throttle body much easier.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_113238\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-113238\" style=\"width: 219px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Bad-Throttle-Body-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-113238\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Bad-Throttle-Body-Diagnosis.png\" alt=\"Toyota Hilux Bad Throttle Body Diagnosis\" width=\"229\" height=\"218\"><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-113238\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Typical Throttle Body<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Dirty Throttle Body<\/h3>\n<p>While coming to a stop, you may notice that your Hilux feels like it wants to die.&nbsp; The RPM may shoot up by as much as 500 until it finally finds the proper idle speed.&nbsp; This is a telltale sign of a dirty throttle body.<\/p>\n<p>It would be prudent to inspect the throttle body to see if there is any grime buildup present.&nbsp; Often the throttle body isn&#8217;t necessarily &#8220;bad&#8221;.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just dirty.&nbsp; A dirty throttle body will exhibit many of the symptoms of a bad throttle body.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a great video showing how to clean a throttle body.&nbsp; Make sure that you use <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2NPqx1Y\">throttle body cleaner<\/a>, and not brake parts cleaner, WD40, or even carb cleaner.&nbsp; Cleaning it is easy and cost effective.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XrcaDh4xDLs\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Wiring Issues<\/h3>\n<p>As your Hilux&#8217;s throttle body opens, the various sensors in your Hilux measure the air coming in, and oxygen content coming out.&nbsp; If any of these sensors goes bad, it can feel the same as a bad throttle body.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why getting the trouble codes is so important.&nbsp; It can really narrow down what you are looking for.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Erratic Idle<\/h3>\n<p>If your Hilux is not letting enough air in at idle, it&#8217;ll struggle to keep running.&nbsp; The idle speed will keep jumping.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion:&nbsp; Toyota Hilux Bad Throttle Body Symptoms<\/h2>\n<p>Good luck diagnosing your Hilux&#8217;s bad throttle body issues.&nbsp; Most of the time, if it is the throttle body, it just needs cleaned.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t forget to see if there are any trouble codes.&nbsp; An engine misfire or bad MAF sensor can cause the same set of symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>If there is anything that you would like to add, please feel free to leave a comment below.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If your Toyota Hilux has a bad throttle body, it can cause it to run terribly.&nbsp;
