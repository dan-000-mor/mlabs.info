Here it is separated into its three main pieces, with a quick explanation of each.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>\u201cB\u201d Camshaft Position<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Overhead-Camshaft.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Overhead-Camshaft.jpg\" alt=\"P0014 Meaning\" class=\"wp-image-177842\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Overhead-Camshaft.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Overhead-Camshaft-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Engines equipped with VVT use camshaft actuators (they&#8217;re often called phasers) to adjust the position of the cam. Adjusting the camshaft timing allows an engine to have a better power curve and better fuel economy (the automotive equivalent of having your cake and eating it too).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the vehicle, <strong>the \u201cB\u201d camshaft is the exhaust, right or rear camshaft<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Over Advanced or System Performance<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>VVT allows an engine to act as though it has different camshaft profiles at different RPMs; this is great for both power and fuel economy. It can advance or retard the timing at will. Sometimes, the system will get stuck in an over-advanced position.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When this happens, your Chevy Silverado will store trouble code P0014.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Valve timing control methods can be quite different for every engine, even from the same manufacturer, but the basics are the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Camshaft actuators or phasers change how long the intake and exhaust valves stay open. They are hydraulic, which means that they use the vehicle\u2019s engine oil to change the intake valve timing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some simpler systems change the cam timing, while others change cam profiles entirely. Here\u2019s a detailed write-up on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.austincc.edu\/wkibbe\/vvt.htm\">exactly how VVT works<\/a> if you\u2019re interested in learning more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bank 1<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bank one is the side of the engine with the first cylinder. If your Silverado has an inline engine, you don\u2019t need to concern yourself with this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if your Silverado has a \u201cV\u201d engine, it\u2019ll have two cylinder heads.&nbsp; You\u2019ll need to look up which side is bank 1. It\u2019s usually the cylinder head closer to the front of the engine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Symptoms of P0014<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis.png\" alt=\"P0014 OBD2 Code Symptoms\" class=\"wp-image-87467\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When the cam timing is off, it can cause some issues with the motor.

A rattling sound can also indicate the timing chain jumped a tooth.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Decreased Gas Mileage<\/strong>\u2013 Now that your Silverado\u2019s engine can no longer adjust its cam timing on the fly, it will no longer be able to produce optimum combustion, which causes poor economy.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lost Power<\/strong>\u2013 Your truck\u2019s engine will not be able to produce as much power; this is because the cam profile will not allow it to run a performance power curve when you need more power.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Service Engine Soon Light<\/strong>&#8211; Most of the time, you\u2019ll be able to feel or see one of the above symptoms, but if you can\u2019t, the check engine light will come on and let you know something is wrong.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hard to Start<\/strong>\u2013 With the timing too far advanced, it won\u2019t be easy to start the motor, especially when it is warm.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Chevy Silverado P0014: Causes + How to Fix<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"P0014 Causes\" class=\"wp-image-190153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the most common causes of the P0014 code in your Chevy Silverado. Start by checking your truck&#8217;s oil level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the most common causes, presented in order from the easiest thing to check to the most difficult:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Engine Oil<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing you should do is check your Silverado\u2019s oil. There are three ways that it can cause P0014:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Low Oil<\/strong>: The most common cause of P0014 is low oil. The oil level needs to be low enough to lower the engine\u2019s oil pressure (dangerously low).&nbsp; If oil flow slows down enough to throw the p0014 code, It\u2019s likely low enough to lock up the engine.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dirty Oil<\/strong>: If the oil and\/or oil filter haven\u2019t been changed in a long time, sometimes it can cause the camshaft actuator to clog up with sludge.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wrong Viscocity<\/strong> (Too Thick or Too Thin):&nbsp; If you recently had an oil change and your Silverado now has this code, change the oil again, and verify that the shop used the right oil.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bad Exhaust Camshaft Position Actuator or Actuator Solenoid<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The actuator solenoid can go bad over time. You certainly don\u2019t want to start here since, a lot of the time, it\u2019ll be something else that causes the P0014 to appear. Here\u2019s a good video that explains how to test the camshaft actuator using a scan tool:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Fixing engine code P0011,P0010\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/KRCUuGk3hPU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Engine Timing<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Silverado\u2019s camshaft(s) are no longer synced to the crankshaft properly (such as if the timing chain jumped a tooth), it can cause the engine timing to be off enough to throw the P0014 (probably <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0011-chevy-silverado\/\" title=\"Chevy Silverado P0011: What it Means + How to Fix\">P0011<\/a>, too), even though it\u2019s not the actuator\u2019s fault.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Wiring Issues<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The wiring from the solenoid to the ECM can become damaged or broken, this will throw the P0014 OBDII code.
