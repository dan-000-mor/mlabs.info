are presented in order (somewhat) of most to least likely to cause the problem.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bad Oxygen Sensor<\/strong>&#8211;\u00a0 The oxygen sensor itself is one of the most likely reasons that the code is triggering your service engine soon light.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Wiring Harness Damage<\/strong>&#8211;\u00a0 The wiring that goes to the front and rear oxygen sensors is very susceptible to damage.\u00a0 This is due to the fact that it is both under the chassis where it is subject to punishment from road debris, and it is right by the heat of the exhaust.\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M4LGykZiRtY\">Here&#8217;s how to find a short in the wiring harness<\/a> (Youtube)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Damage to the Terminal<\/strong>&#8211;\u00a0 The terminal that the oxygen sensor connects to (the plug) is also relatively susceptible to damage.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Blown Heater Sensor Circuit Fuse<\/strong>&#8211;\u00a0 Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lb0uSi6M37Y\">how to test if a fuse is blown<\/a>\u00a0(Youtube).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bad\/Wrong O2 Sensor<\/strong>&#8211;\u00a0 If you are getting P0135 after having recently replaced your Oxygen sensor, it may be that the replacement is wrong or bad.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>P0135 Diagnosis<\/h2>\n<p>Here is a fantastic video that covers all aspects of diagnosing a P0135 trouble code.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7uqmYkl7t0c\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>It is entirely possible to diagnose the P0135 with a <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2R5T309\">multimeter<\/a>.\u00a0 If you use the multimeter, you&#8217;ll know whether or not the voltage coming to and from the oxygen sensor are within spec.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have access to a multimeter, it certainly wouldn&#8217;t hurt to check the wiring to between the fuse box and the Oxygen sensor first.\u00a0 If it ends up being a wiring issue, it&#8217;ll save you money over buying an unnecessary O2 sensor.<\/p>\n<figure

simple voltage test light can tell you whether or not the harness has any power at all<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>You can also use a voltage test light to determine whether or not the oxygen sensor is getting any voltage at all (they&#8217;re about $5 at Wal-Mart).\u00a0 If it&#8217;s not getting any voltage, attache the test light to the harness plug and shake the wiring a little bit.\u00a0 If the light comes on, even for a second, you know that you have a short circuit causing the P0135 trouble code.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Most of the time with P0135, it&#8217;s going to be the oxygen sensor itself that has caused the code to trigger.\u00a0 Good luck finding whatever caused it in your vehicle.\u00a0 If you have anything that you would like to add, please feel
