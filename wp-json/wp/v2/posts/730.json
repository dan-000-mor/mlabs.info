the car had from the factory. \u00a0If that is not the case, than you are going to need be very careful about picking the right converter. \u00a0In a modern\u00a0LS type engine, even when they make good power the stall doesn&#8217;t have to be extreme because the heads make more power. \u00a0This allows for a less aggressive cam profile, which allows the engine to retain decent bottom end power.
