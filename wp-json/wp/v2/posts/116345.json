Wiring\/Fuses<\/h3>\n<p>Looking to see if your Freestar blew a fuse is a great place to start.&nbsp; This is particularly true if the window does not seem to have been struggling before it failed to go up.<\/p>\n<p>If all of the windows don&#8217;t work, that is going to be a fuse or window relay that has gone bad.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to locate the fuse box, and then the power window fuse.&nbsp; It&#8217;s pretty easy to tell if a fuse is blown.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lb0uSi6M37Y\">good video<\/a> (YouTube) on how to tell if a fuse is blown.&nbsp; The easiest way is with a test light.&nbsp; Or, you can pull it and use your eyes to see if it&#8217;s blown with a visual inspection.<\/p>\n<p>If the fuse is blown, replacing it will get your power window to go up.&nbsp; If it keeps blowing, you&#8217;ll need to figure out what is causing your wiring harness to short out.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s a great resource on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.liveabout.com\/car-electrical-how-to-find-a-short-circuit-4156483\">finding a short<\/a> (liveabout.com).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. Window Switch<\/h3>\n<p>Your power window switch can go bad.&nbsp; They are exposed to the elements every time that you open the door.&nbsp; They function very simply.&nbsp; There is a 12 volt signal at the switch.&nbsp; It sends that signal to the power window motor.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you put a voltmeter on it, there should be 12 volts in as long as the key is on, and \u00b112 volts out when you press the switch.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a great YouTube video on exactly how to do this from Tom A on how to test the switch and see if the motor is bad.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Lmt3SfY0-no\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3.
