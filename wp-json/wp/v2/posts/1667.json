\u00a0The TH350 is controlled by engine vacuum and a kick down cable. \u00a0The 200-4R is controlled by a TV cable. \u00a0The best way to think of the TV cable is as a throttle position sensor. \u00a0It controls shifts based on how much throttle is being given at any time. \u00a0It is easy to swap transmission control to a TV cable if you are thinking about swapping to a 200-4R. \u00a0Here is more info on the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/parts\/2004r-700r4\/tv-cable\/\">TV cable<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Overdrive<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0The 200-4R uses an overdrive gear to reduce engine RPM at highway speed. \u00a0The TH350 has three forward gears and no overdrive. \u00a0It&#8217;s worth noting that the overdrive gear on the 200-4R is even more aggressive than the 700R4. \u00a0.70(700R4) vs .67(200-4R), which means that the 200-4R will make the engine turn even slower on the highway.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are many other differences between the two transmissions that are noteworthy as well. \u00a0This is a broad take on these differences.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Locking Torque Converter<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0The 200-4R has a locking torque converter, which means that a clutch will engage at a high enough speed and allow for a true direct connection between the engine and transmission. \u00a0This increases fuel economy and slightly lowers RPM going down the road. \u00a0You have to set up wiring to make it work in a car that it was never equipped with. \u00a0A car with originally equipped with a TH350 is not going to have the wiring built-in.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Length<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0The TH350 is a barely shorter than the 200-4R, but the mount is about 6 inches further back. \u00a0This may cause some problems with finding the right crossmember if you were to swap one for the other.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Gear Ratios<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0The TH350&#8217;s gears are placed closer together (despite having less of them). \u00a0But, they are much closer tougher than the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/2004r-vs-700r4-differences\/\">200-4R vs 700R4<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>TH350 vs 200-4R Gearing<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1st<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2nd<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3rd<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4th<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reverse<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>200-4R<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.74<\/span><\/td>\n<td>1.57<\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.00<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0.67<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.07<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>TH350<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.52<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.52<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.00<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">N\/A<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.92<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>200-4R vs TH350: \u00a0Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>There is one main question that you need to be asking yourself:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What is overdrive worth to you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Almost every modern car has an overdrive transmission. \u00a0If you didn&#8217;t grow up in the time when a TH350 equipped car would be in your daily driver, you may not remember the engine screaming down the highway. \u00a0It is not as fun as it sounds.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s much nicer to listen to the engine hum\u00a0down the highway in overdrive sipping, not guzzling, the gas. \u00a0Unless you really want to do hardcore racing, you should take a look at the 200-4R. \u00a0There&#8217;s not a whole lot involved in swapping one to the other, and it&#8217;ll make driving your car a joy!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The TH350 was GM&#8217;s go to transmission for light duty vehicles from the late sixties through the early eighties, that is until the 700R4 and 200-4R began to replace it. \u00a0When comparing the 200-4R (often called the 200r4) vs the TH350 there are quite a few differences, and also quite a bit in common.
