Water in the gas tank can also cause gas to be bad. If there were no other symptoms and suddenly you find that the vehicle is running very rough, bad gas could certainly be the problem. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cars.com\/articles\/got-bad-gas-heres-what-you-should-know-1420683208297\/\">good article<\/a> on all the symptoms of bad gas.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Throttle Position Sensor<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp; The throttle position sensor is typically located on the gas pedal. &nbsp;This sensor is responsible for telling the engine how much air and fuel to allow in. &nbsp;Long gone are the days when you were actually directly controlling the amount of fuel and air entering the engine. &nbsp;These days the computer handles all of that.This serves two purposes. &nbsp;The first is that by limiting the amount of torque when you push the gas pedal for a second or two, the engineers at GM were able to increase engine life by reducing the stress on it during takeoff. &nbsp;The second is improved fuel economy.\n<p>When the throttle position sensor fails, it defaults to idle speed. &nbsp;Otherwise, the vehicle could take off on you and cause an accident. &nbsp;So, if the Equinox loses signal from the Throttle Position Sensor for a moment, it&#8217;ll feel like a stall.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a great article on diagnosing a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.carsdirect.com\/car-repair\/how-to-tell-if-you-have-a-faulty-throttle-position-sensor\">bad throttle position sensor<\/a> from cars direct.<\/li>\n<li><strong>VVT Problem<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;The variable valve timing associate with the 2.4L engine can cause the Equinox to stall.It&#8217;ll throw trouble P0010 or P0011. &nbsp;This is often the cause of the stalling. &nbsp;The code is for Intake Camshaft Position Actuator Solenoid Valve Control Circuit. &nbsp;What a mouthful!If these trouble codes have been thrown, than there&#8217;s a good chance this is the problem. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gUjdgn_HQz0\">great video<\/a> on the problem.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Good luck with fixing your Equinox stalling issues!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the most common issues with the 2nd generation Chevy Equinox is a stalling problem. &nbsp;The most challenging part of the problem is that they are known to stall at any time.
