&nbsp;Your Savana may run rich or lean when idling, or it may also idle erratically. &nbsp;A rich condition is when there is not enough air relative to the fuel in the air\/fuel mixture. &nbsp;The exhaust color is usually darker when running rich. &nbsp;A lean condition is when there is too much air relative to fuel in the air fuel mixture. &nbsp;The exhaust color usually doesn&#8217;t change.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hard to Start<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;Without knowing the proper amount of air entering into the intake, it can be really difficult for the engine to start. &nbsp;And when it does, it doesn&#8217;t usually run very well.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Jerking<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;As you go down the road, you&#8217;ll feel your Savana really jerk and hesitate as the engine speed changes erratically. &nbsp;It&#8217;s bad for your motor mounts when this happens. &nbsp;Also, jerking can be caused by <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-spark-plug-symptoms-GMC-Savana\/\">bad spark plugs<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-coil-pack-symptoms-GMC-Savana\/\">coil packs<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Decreased Fuel Mileage<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;Fuel mileage can suffer without the proper air\/fuel mixture.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_82175\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82175\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Bad-Mass-Airflow-Sensor-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-82175\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Bad-Mass-Airflow-Sensor-Diagnosis-300x150.png\" alt=\"GMC Savana Bad Mass Airflow Sensor Diagnosis\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Bad-Mass-Airflow-Sensor-Diagnosis-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Bad-Mass-Airflow-Sensor-Diagnosis.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-82175\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Here a couple of common MAF sensor styles<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Savana Bad MAF Sensor Diagnosis<\/h2>\n<p>If the MAF sensor has gone bad, it&#8217;ll trigger the check engine light and provide an OBDII trouble code. &nbsp;This is great because it helps you narrow down the problem. &nbsp;The two most common trouble codes in relation to the MAF sensor are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0101-GMC-Savana\/\">GMC Savana P0101 Diagnosis: MAF Sensor<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0102-GMC-Savana\/\">GMC Savana P0102: MAF Sensor Circuit Low<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are other codes related to the mass air flow sensor as well, but these are the most common ones. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s a fantastic video on how to diagnose a bad MAF sensor using a multimeter from Ratchets and Wrenches on YouTube.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/p0ocaDmcAIM\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Cleaning the Mass Airflow Sensor<\/h2>\n<p>Often, the mass airflow sensor really only needs cleaning when they go bad. &nbsp;Some folks recommend using alcohol because it&#8217;s usually on hand, and can clean the sensor. &nbsp;This is a bad idea, it can ruin the sensor. &nbsp;Uses mass airflow sensor cleaner. &nbsp;It&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2ZvdxmO\">really cheap<\/a> and available at any parts store. &nbsp;It sure beats the heck out of having to buy a new sensor.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Locate the MAF Sensor<\/strong>&#8211;
