The common theme of the issues listed below are a faulty reading from a sensor that is critical to the operation of the vehicle. \u00a0Once you understand that, than the only question left to ask is it a false reading or is there something really wrong?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Computer Problems<\/span>&#8211; \u00a0A problem with the vehicles ECM can cause limp mode, although this is definitely not where you should start looking, but<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Damaged Electrical Connection<\/span>&#8211; \u00a0Over the life of a vehicle the wiring harness that connects the transmission to the ECM can become damaged. \u00a0This can alter the signal that the computer receives, triggering limp mode. \u00a0This is much more likely than a computer problem.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Loose Connection<\/span>&#8211; \u00a0Older vehicles have had over twenty years to get a loose connection on one of it&#8217;s wiring harness plugs. \u00a0All wiring harnesses utilize plastic keepers to secure them to the sensors. \u00a0Plastic melts and breaks just like everything else. \u00a0Has your vehicle been in the shop in the last few months? \u00a0Maybe the mechanic damaged a connection or didn&#8217;t quite get a harness snapped in all of the way. \u00a0You would be shocked just how much this can and does occur.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Water Damage<\/span>&#8211; \u00a0The thing about modern vehicles is that they are virtually bulletproof compared to the old non computer controlled predecessors. \u00a0But, their Achilles heal is the complex wiring that they use to operate. \u00a0It can be confusing to deal with. \u00a0If you&#8217;ve gotten the harness wet or suspect your vehicle has been in a flood, this very well could be causing your limp mode situation.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Faulty Sensor<\/span>&#8211; \u00a0Your vehicle relies on many sensors. \u00a0These include the MAP sensor, throttle position, crank position, and vehicle speed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s more on <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/how-to-fix-limp-mode\/\">how to fix limp mode<\/a>, if you didn&#8217;t find what you were looking for above.<\/p>\n<h2>What Limp Mode Does to Protect Your Vehicle<\/h2>\n<p>If your vehicles ECM receives signal that there may be a potentially catastrophic issue, it&#8217;ll trigger the limp mode and trigger your check engine light. \u00a0It than switches all of the vehicles timing and shift tables over to a less aggressive (and therefore less damaging) performance table. \u00a0Think about it like starting your computer in safe mode.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Limp-Mode.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-873\" src=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Limp-Mode.png\" alt=\"Limp Mode Causes and Solutions\" width=\"535\" height=\"115\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Limp-Mode.png 535w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Limp-Mode-300x64.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Limp-Mode-100x21.png 100w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Limp-Mode-150x32.png 150w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Limp-Mode-200x43.png 200w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Limp-Mode-450x97.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In a transmission the computer will increase the pressure in the lines in order to protect the clutches. \u00a0This makes shifts way more rough (if your vehicles limp mode gives you more than one gear) \u00a0Although it seems counterintuitive, a hard shifting transmission is better on the clutches and bands because it allows for less slipping.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>All vehicles built after 1996 have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.obdii.com\/background.html\">OBD2<\/a> built into them. \u00a0Head to your nearest <a href=\"http:\/\/www.autozone.com\/storelocator\/storeLocatorMain.jsp\">AutoZone<\/a> and have it tested. \u00a0Make sure that you head the limp mode warning and actually take the vehicle in for repair and don&#8217;t drive it like that for long. \u00a0There is a good chance that you could be causing more damage to the vehicle every second that you continue to drive it. \u00a0Hopefully you won&#8217;t end up finding out that you are looking at a major repair. \u00a0Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Any automatic transmission made within the last 15 or 20 years is going to be a computer controlled. \u00a0And, just like a modern engine, the computer now knows when there&#8217;s something wrong with the transmission. \u00a0If the computer thinks that there&#8217;s some sort of critical problem is going to destroy the transmission, it will put &#8230;
