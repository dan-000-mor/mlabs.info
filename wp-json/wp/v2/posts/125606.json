Noise<\/h3>\n<p>A noisy water pump can indicate that it has a bearing that is going out. &nbsp;The problem with most engine noises is that they are difficult to hunt down. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If your water pump is easy to reach, you can gently place a really long screwdriver tip against it. &nbsp;Then, place the handle end of the screwdriver against your ear. &nbsp;You should be able to hear the noise clearly coming from the water pump.<\/p>\n<p>Be careful, there are a lot of moving parts around the water pump.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. Leaking Water Pump<\/h3>\n<p>Water leaking from around your Focus&#8217;s water pump is a sure indication that the water pump could be bad. &nbsp;It could be the water pump or the water pump gasket causing the leak. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You have to pull the water pump to replace the gasket. &nbsp;Due to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=Ford+Focus+Water+Pump&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=00e8ee445e14ef5791883a7cebd07c5e&amp;language=en_US\">relative low price<\/a> of a water pump in relation to how much work it takes to get off, we recommend replacing the water pump even if the gasket is bad.<\/p>\n<h3>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<h3>3. Low Coolant Level<\/h3>\n<p>If the coolant is leaking out of the water pump from somewhere, you&#8217;re going to get low coolant. &nbsp;The problem is that low coolant can indicate a lot of different problems. &nbsp;It can indicate a bad radiator, radiator hose, or <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Ford-Focus-bad-thermostat-symptoms\/\">thermostat<\/a> housing as well.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. Overheating and\/or Steam<\/h3>\n<p>If your Focus has leaked enough radiator fluid, there won&#8217;t be enough left to properly cool your engine, and it&#8217;ll overheat.<\/p>\n<p>Steam will rise out of the hood if engine coolant is leaking onto the exhaust.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Bad Water Pump Behavior<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Bad-Water-Pump-Symptoms.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-124679\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Bad-Water-Pump-Symptoms.png\" alt=\"Ford Focus Bad Water Pump Symptoms\" width=\"250\" height=\"186\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It can be tough trying to figure out if your Focus&#8217;s water pump is bad. &nbsp;The signs of a bad water pump are the same as a lot of other radiator components.<\/p>\n<p>A water pump that is struggling to function will cause your Focus to <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Ford-Focus-Running-Hot\/\">run hot<\/a>. &nbsp;If you have a temperature gauge and you see that your Focus is running hotter than it should be, try parking and revving the engine a bit (in neutral or park). &nbsp;If the gauge goes down, that would be a very strong indicator that the water pump is bad.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Bad Water Pump Causes: &nbsp;Ford Focus<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some of the most common problems that can lead to a bad water pump:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Dry Rotation<\/h3>\n<p>Your Focus&#8217;s water pump is designed to rotate with coolant inside of it. &nbsp;This helps create a watertight seal that can withstand the pressure in the cooling system.<\/p>\n<p>Without water the fluid cushion between the two rings (shaft and stationary) is lost. &nbsp;These rings will quickly fail and you&#8217;ll be stuck with a slow leak from the water pump.<\/p>\n<p>This can happen when you&#8217;ve allowed your Focus to run without coolant, or if you&#8217;ve recently replaced the water pump and dry started it without any coolant.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Bad\/Improper Seal<\/h3>\n<p>Over time, the seal can go bad around the water pump. &nbsp;It&#8217;ll start leaking water and go bad. &nbsp;A big mistake that people make when they put a new water pump on is to use a bunch of gasket sealer. &nbsp;Most manufacturers will only recommend a small amount in a few key places or none at all.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Wrong Coolant<\/h3>\n<p>It is imperative that you follow the Ford&#8217;s directions when it comes to the type of coolant that you use. &nbsp;The wrong coolant can eat away at the gasket.<\/p>\n<p>Contaminants in the cooling system can wear down the gasket and seals as well. &nbsp;Using the wrong coolant can cause internal rust and corrosion. &nbsp;This corrosion will effectively water blast the water pump.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Bad Bearings<\/h3>\n<p>Your water has bearings in the rotating assembly. &nbsp;They can fail like any other bearing. &nbsp;If the bearings are bad it usually won&#8217;t do so quietly. &nbsp;A horrible squeaking noise that goes up and down with your Focus&#8217;s engine RPM should be observed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Serpentine Belt<\/h3>\n<p>The serpentine belt can cause the water pump to go bad if it&#8217;s been improperly installed, or if there&#8217;s too much tension on it. &nbsp;Here are some common signs that a <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Ford-Focus-bad-serpentine-belt\/\">serpentine belt<\/a> is bad. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Focus Bad Water Pump Symptoms<\/h2>\n<p>A bad water pump has the potential to cause a lot of engine damage. &nbsp;Getting ahead of it before your Focus <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Ford-Focus-overheating-symptoms-causes\/\">overheats<\/a> will save you a lot of money. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for reading. &nbsp;We really hope that this helps. &nbsp;Please feel free to leave a comment below with any questions or concerns that you may have.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your Ford Focus&#8217;s water pump is one of the most crucial parts of the engine. &nbsp;If it doesn&#8217;t pump water through the engine, it&#8217;s going to overheat and do a lot of damage. &nbsp;Typical signs of a bad water pump include overheating, white smoke, a bad smell, rough idle, and more.
