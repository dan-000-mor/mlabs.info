It converts the mechanical pressure reading into a voltage value that the PCM understands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the PCM, the oil pressure is sent to the oil pressure gauge (or warning light).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>High Input<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The voltage value is almost at or above its highest possible value (which tells the PCM that the oil pressure level is very high).  If the input was low, you&#8217;d have <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0522-Subaru-Liberty\/\">P0522<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Subaru Liberty P0523 Symptoms<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Liberty may feel like it&#8217;s running and driving fine, but even without symptoms, you shouldn&#8217;t drive it with P0523 until you verify the oil pressure is fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the most common symptoms associated with P0523:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Check engine light<\/li><li>High oil pressure reading on the gauge or the oil pressure light could be on<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>P0523 Subaru Liberty Causes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"P0523 Diagnosis\" class=\"wp-image-190153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Two things are going on.  Either the oil pressure is too high, or there is an issue related to the oil pressure sensor. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the most common causes of P0523 in the Subaru Liberty and the proper order to check them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Check the Oil<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Verify that the oil level isn&#8217;t overly full.  Is it sludgy?  Is it the proper weight?  If you didn&#8217;t pour it in yourself, it&#8217;s possible that the wrong viscosity was used the last time the oil was changed.  Consider this possibility if you got P0523 right after an oil change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bad Oil Pressure Sensor &#8211; Wiring<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the oil level is correct,  it&#8217;s not old, and it&#8217;s the proper viscosity, it&#8217;s time to look at your Liberty&#8217;s oil pressure sensor.  A wiring failure is widespread with these sensors due to their proximity to the exhaust.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspect the harness for any obvious damage.  Look for cracked, broken, burnt, or brittle wiring.  Follow the harness as long as you can, but pay particular attention to it within a couple of feet of where it plugs into the head.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Test the Oil Pressure Sensor<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the oil pressure switch\/sensor with a simple multimeter.  The video below will show you how to do it for just about every type of oil pressure sensor.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could also get a mechanical oil pressure tester from a place like AutoZone or Harbor Freight.  They&#8217;re usually around $25-$40 and will 100% tell you if you have a real oil pressure problem.  That&#8217;s about the same price as a new oil pressure sensor, and you&#8217;ll be plugging into the same hole anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the manual oil pressure checks out, you have positive proof that your Liberty doesn&#8217;t have a sensor or wiring issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How to test an oil pressure switch - with tutorial\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/xbJmRERZUSg?start=96&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mechanical Issues<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While a bad oil pressure sensor or wiring issue is the most common cause of P0523, it&#8217;s not the only one.  If your Liberty has a faulty oil pump or restricted oil passaged can also cause this code.  You can verify this with an oil pressure test kit (it&#8217;s just a mechanical oil gauge with adapters to fit most makes\/models).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are a few issues that can cause P0523 in they Subaru Liberty, start by checking the oil and testing the oil pressure sensor.  More often than not, that&#8217;ll fix the code.  Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>P0523 is a standard OBD2 trouble code that can occur in the Subaru Liberty.
