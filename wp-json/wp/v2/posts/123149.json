Slipping Transmission (Low Speed)<\/h3>\n<p>The torque converter &#8220;stall speed&#8221; is the speed that the engine needs to be turning before the torque converter will begin engaging the transmission. &nbsp;When a torque converter is malfunctioning it can cause this stall speed to change and feel like the transmission is slipping. &nbsp;If you suspect this is happening with your car, has your fuel mileage changed? &nbsp;This is often a sign that the transmission isn&#8217;t operating efficiently.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">More Info: <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Camry-transmission-slipping\/\">Camry Transmission Slipping Diagnosis<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">2. Slipping (Higher Speed)<\/span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<p>Nearly all modern automatic transmissions have a locking torque converter. &nbsp;A locking converter has clutches in it that lets the transmission make a physical connection with the engine. &nbsp;This eliminates operating inefficiency when it is at high speed (usually after about 45 miles an hour). &nbsp;This increases the fuel mileage achieved and brings an automatic transmissions efficiency more in line with a standard transmission.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. Bad Fuel Economy<\/h3>\n<p>If the torque converter has gone bad, then it&#8217;s no longer transferring power to your Camry&#8217;s rear wheels in an efficient manner. &nbsp;This keeps your Camry&#8217;s engine from turning at the right RPM for any given speed, which can really hurt fuel economy. &nbsp;When this happens, your torque converter has a higher effective <strong>stall speed<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. Shuddering<\/h3>\n<p>Torque converters use a lock up clutch to create a true 1:1 connection between the engine and the wheels. &nbsp;It won&#8217;t do this at lower speeds so your Camry can take advantage of the torque multiplication that a torque converter provides. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If the torque converter fails to unlock at lower speeds, it shudders. &nbsp;This shudder feels like a manual transmission when you need to downshift.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>5. Sounds<\/h3>\n<p>A bad torque converter will often make strange sounds. &nbsp;The best way to describe the sound would be a <strong>whir sound<\/strong> if you have bad bearings in it and a <strong>clunking sound<\/strong> if it&#8217;s a bad turbine fin.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>6. Bad Transmission Fluid<\/h3>\n<p>Like your automatic transmission, the torque converter is full of transmission fluid. &nbsp;This fluid helps cool the converter and transfers energy. &nbsp;If your Camry has bad transmission fluid, it can cause the torque converter to go bad.<\/p>\n<p>Taking a look at the transmission fluid should be the first thing that you do. &nbsp;It can tell you a lot about the health of your transmission in general.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Causes of Torque Converter Problems: &nbsp;Toyota Camry<\/h2>\n<p>There are many different things that can cause your Camry to have torque converter problems. &nbsp;Here are the most common ones.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">1. Low or Dirty Transmission Fluid<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Transmission-Color-Chart.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-882 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Transmission-Color-Chart-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Toyota Camry Bad Torque Converter Signs\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Transmission-Color-Chart-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Transmission-Color-Chart-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Transmission-Color-Chart-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Transmission-Color-Chart-100x100.jpg 100w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Transmission-Color-Chart-200x200.jpg 200w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Transmission-Color-Chart-450x450.jpg 450w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Transmission-Color-Chart-600x600.jpg 600w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Transmission-Color-Chart.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Transmission fluid is the lifeblood of the transmission and the torque converter bolted to it. &nbsp;If there isn&#8217;t enough it can&#8217;t do its job. &nbsp;This will in turn cause the transmission to overheat. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This is one of the most common causes of torque converter problems. &nbsp;If the transmission fluid is dirty and old it won&#8217;t be able to do its job as a hydraulic fluid as well. &nbsp;This can lead to a feeling of extra slipping and chattering at speed. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Make sure you take a <strong>look at the fluid before you do anything<\/strong> with your transmission. &nbsp;If you don&#8217;t know or can&#8217;t remember the last time it was changed or serviced this would be the place to start. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/what-color-is-transmission-fluid\/\">transmission fluid color chart<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">2. Worn Clutches<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The clutch that locks the transmission to the engine at highway speed can wear out just like a normal manual transmission clutch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">3. Bad Seals<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This is one of the most common issues that causes a torque converter to go bad. &nbsp;It&#8217;s usually pretty detectable, as there will be a pool of fluid underneath your Camry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">4. Loose Torque Converter Bolts &nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This will create the same symptoms as the bad seals in that the converter is going to puke a bunch of ATF all over your garage floor, but you should also be feeling quite the vibration at speed. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">If you suspect this could be what is going on with your transmission, just know that if those bolts come all the way out the least that is going to happen is that it disengages from the input shaft. &nbsp;Most likely it&#8217;s going to really do some real damage to the crank and input shaft.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Faulty Torque Converter Diagnosis<\/h2>\n<p>Before trying to diagnose whether your Camry has a bad torque converter, you&#8217;ll want to drive to let the transmission warm up to its normal operating temperature. &nbsp;It takes a bit longer for the transmission to warm up than the engine. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Give it a few extra minutes after the engine warms up all the way. This will ensure that the transmission is shifting as it would nearly all the time that it normally operates.<\/p>\n<p>Pay attention to what&#8217;s going on with both your Camry&#8217;s engine and transmission. &nbsp;Pay particular attention to any shuddering and vibration as you accelerate. &nbsp;Shuddering and vibration are in no way a guarantee that something is wrong with the torque converter, but they are a strong indicator there could be something wrong.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Camry Torque Converter Problems<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to get to your torque converter, which means that you have to rely on observation to determine if the torque converter is going bad. &nbsp;This makes diagnosing torque converter problems challenging. &nbsp;Good luck with your Camry!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your Toyota Camry&#8217;s torque converter is responsible for converting the energy generated by the engine at the flywheel and transferring it to the transmission, creating a bridge between the engine and the transmission. &nbsp; In the Toyota Camry, a bad torque converter is often caused by bad transmission fluid, worn clutches, bad seals, or loose &#8230; <a title=\"Toyota Camry:  Bad Torque Converter \u2192 Symptoms + Diagnosis\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/toyota-camry-bad-torque-converter-signs\/\" aria-label=\"More on Toyota Camry:  Bad Torque Converter \u2192 Symptoms + Diagnosis\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[248],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/123149"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=123149"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/123149\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=123149"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=123149"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=123149"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
