\u00a0If you never have here&#8217;s a quick write up on how <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/how-to-check-transmission-fluid\/\">check automatic transmission fluid<\/a>. \u00a0There&#8217;s really not much to it at all. \u00a0Just make sure that you are on a flat surface and have the vehicle up to the proper operating temperature.<\/p>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to take a look at the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/what-color-is-transmission-fluid\/\">transmission fluid color<\/a>. \u00a0You can learn a ton from examining it. \u00a0Most transmission fluid is pink or light red, depending on what you see when you look at that color. \u00a0A transmission light can come on if dirty fluid has begun to affect the operation of the transmission itself.<\/p>\n<p>If the fluid is really dark or cloudy, it may be time to have the transmission serviced. \u00a0You can certainly look up how to change your own fluid on <a href=\"http:\/\/youtube.com\">YouTube<\/a>. \u00a0It&#8217;s really not that difficult on most cars. \u00a0If changing oils a 3\/10 in difficulty, than changing transmission fluid is going to be about a 5\/10.<\/p>\n<p>If you do end up changing bad fluid, give the transmission light a bit to turn itself back off.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Has Your Vehicle Felt Different?<\/h2>\n<p>Though the powers of observation, you can determine a lot about what is going on with your transmission, and why the transmission light might be on in the first place. \u00a0It&#8217;s like eating bad food &#8220;the nose knows&#8221;. \u00a0You should know your car enough to know too.<\/p>\n<p>Has the engine felt like it&#8217;s been revving faster as you go down the road? \u00a0That&#8217;s a pretty good indication that the transmission is low on fluid. \u00a0It&#8217;s important to know the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/low-transmission-fluid-signs\/\">signs of low transmission fluid<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If it feels like the engine could be revving ever so faster going down the highway, but the transmission fluid level is just fine, than you could be looking at the torque converter lock being messed up.<\/p>\n<p>Theres&#8217; a second brake light switch that serves to lock the torque converter. \u00a0It is typically the culprit in situations like this. \u00a0It&#8217;s very easy to change.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Maybe It&#8217;s Nothing (Maybe it&#8217;s Not)<\/h2>\n<p>Your transmission light will come on when the complex set of sensors in the cars computer tells it that something is operating out of spec. \u00a0Sometimes it&#8217;ll give a false positive and trigger the light.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t recommend ignoring it. \u00a0You don&#8217;t want to end up stuck somewhere when the transmission inevitably gives out. \u00a0At the very least, take the car up to <a href=\"http:\/\/autozone.com\">Autozone<\/a> and have them do a code scan. \u00a0They can tell you what the car says is wrong. \u00a0If it&#8217;s something like a speed sensor, and the speedometer still works, it&#8217;s probably nothing.<\/p>\n<p>What you don&#8217;t want to avoid are the signs that your transmission is going out. \u00a0These signs are clunking, slipping, and otherwise operating in a way that doesn&#8217;t feel normal. \u00a0If that seems to be what is going on with your transmission, get it repaired before your on the side of the highway or you get stuck in <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/limp-mode-causes-and-solutions\/\">limp mode<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: \u00a0Transmission Light<\/h2>\n<p>The transmission light can help you fix the problem before the transmission destroys itself. \u00a0It&#8217;s a really great idea to go ahead and have it looked at before the repair bill explodes.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When the transmission light comes on it is important to pay attention to your vehicle.
