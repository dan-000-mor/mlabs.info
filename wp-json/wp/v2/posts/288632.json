Then, use the table above to help you narrow down the potential causes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be a few causes for why your car is making that sloshing sound. If the sound is happening while you&#8217;re driving, it likely indicates that water is trapped somewhere in your A4, a fluid is low in one of your systems, or air has gotten someplace it does not belong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Clogged Evaporator Drain<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Evaporator-Core.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Evaporator-Core-1024x664.jpg\" alt=\"Sloshing sound evaporator\" class=\"wp-image-275881\" width=\"351\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Evaporator-Core-1024x664.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Evaporator-Core-300x194.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Evaporator-Core-768x498.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Evaporator-Core-1536x995.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Evaporator-Core-2048x1327.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A common cause for water sloshing is a clogged EVAP drain. Water frequently needs to be drained between the cooling system. If the drain has become blocked by sediment buildup, the water won&#8217;t drain and will instead become trapped in your A4&#8217;s body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The water will collect in the pan. You&#8217;ll generally hear this sloshing sound near your car&#8217;s dashboard. It&#8217;s especially noticeable when you&#8217;re taking turns.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s usually accompanied by a moldy smell if left too long. In extreme cases, your floor mat may even feel damp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Fix for Clogged Evaporator Drain<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to tell if your evaporator drain is clogged is to start your A4 and let it idle for a while with the AC on full blast.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look under the front of the vehicle. If no water leaks onto the ground after running the air conditioning for a while, that indicates that the drain hole is clogged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A clogged evaporator drain tube does more than let water build up and create a water-sloshing sound. It can also create a hospitable place for mold and bacteria to grow. Your A4&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/audi-a4-ac-smells-bad-smell-id-how-to-fix\/\" title=\"Audi A4 AC Smells Bad: Smell ID + How to Fix\">AC will likely smell bad<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"AC Drain Tube Clogged In Vehicle\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/kQ7TIYFU-u8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully the fix for this is straightforward and not usually too expensive. If you know a little about vehicles, you might even be able to do it yourself.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Locate the evaporator drain tube under your A4, blow some condensed air into the tube, or insert a flexible metal rod. Trapped water will likely rush out at this point, so be careful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Low Coolant<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Overflow-Car.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Overflow-Car.jpg\" alt=\"Low Coolant Sloshing Sound\" class=\"wp-image-178728\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Overflow-Car.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Overflow-Car-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Toyoa A4 is low on coolant, you&#8217;ll be able to hear the remaining liquid sloshing around right after you start your vehicle and when you&#8217;re driving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Low coolant and air in the system will make a sloshing sound when the engine speed changes. However, it should not react to any other driving condition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Fix for Low Coolant<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You will need to fill the system back up with coolant. But you&#8217;ll need to address why the coolant leaked out in the first place. If you don&#8217;t, your vehicle will overheat, and the repair expense will significantly increase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspect the <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/audi-a4-radiator-leak\/\" title=\"\">radiator<\/a>, hoses, water pump, and thermostat housing for leaking coolant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Air in Cooling System<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Radiator.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Radiator.jpg\" alt=\"cooling system sloshing\n\" class=\"wp-image-181220\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Radiator.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Radiator-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If your coolant levels are normal and your A4 still makes that concerning sloshing sound after you turn it on, and while it&#8217;s idling and changes with RPM, you may have air in the cooling system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sound will come from the heater core behind the dashboard and can happen for many reasons. Test or replace the radiator cap if you don&#8217;t see a leak.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Fix for Air in Coolant System<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You won&#8217;t want to leave air in your coolant system.

But it&#8217;s true; rainwater sneaks into the its body from all sorts of places. One of the most common locations is between the door and the windows, where rain can seep down and get into the door.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of this reason, vehicles are built with drains in the base of the doors. But over time, those drains can become blocked by dirt and debris. As a result, water will build up, and you&#8217;ll hear it as you drive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Fix for Clogged Door Drains<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily this is a straightforward fix. Take your A4 somewhere quiet, and swing the doors back and forth gently. You know this is it if you hear the vehicle make sloshing water sounds.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a bit of flexible wire and break up the debris until water comes out of the drain again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this is a simple fix, you&#8217;ll want to take care of this problem quickly. Leaving water to linger in the body of your car can result in mold, a problem that will not only smell but could result in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mold\/faqs.htm#:~:text=Some%20people%20are%20sensitive%20to,may%20have%20more%20intense%20reactions.\">health problems<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Fuel Tank<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Diesel-Fuel.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"348\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Diesel-Fuel.jpg\" alt=\"Audi A4 Fuel Tank Slosh\" class=\"wp-image-178745\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Diesel-Fuel.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Diesel-Fuel-300x209.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how large or small your A4&#8217;s fuel tank may be.
