Is the check engine light on?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-87467\" width=\"178\" height=\"178\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 178px) 100vw, 178px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If the check engine light is on, pull the codes if there are error codes related to the vehicle speed sensor.&nbsp; The most common one is P0500 (VSS Malfunction), which indicates the VSS needs to be replaced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Is the Odometer Working?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Odometer.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Odometer.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-300477\" width=\"397\" height=\"192\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Odometer.jpg 602w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Odometer-300x146.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Oldsmobile Silhouette\u2019s odometer is working normally, the VSS is working fine, which means the speedometer has likely failed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Does Cruise Control Work?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Cruise-Control.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Cruise-Control.jpg\" alt=\"speedometer diagnosis\" class=\"wp-image-300478\" width=\"383\" height=\"211\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Cruise-Control.jpg 830w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Cruise-Control-300x166.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Cruise-Control-768x426.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Take your Silhouette out and see if the cruise control still works.&nbsp; If it does, that&#8217;s a good indication that the vehicle speed sensor is fine.&nbsp; If cruise control isn&#8217;t working, the VSS is likely at fault.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After testing the cruise control, you want to move on to the VSS and the wiring going to and from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Use a Scanner to Determine if the VSS is Reporting any Speed <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Plug a good scanner into the OBD II port. You can configure it to report the vehicle&#8217;s speed as reported by the VSS. If it says 0 MPH while driving, the VSS has likely caused your Oldsmobile Silhouette&#8217;s speedometer to stop working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video below shows exactly how to use a scanner to test the VSS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How to Fix a Speedometer Gauge in Your Car (Speed Sensor)\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/KE64o3NAdkY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Common Questions\">Common Questions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do you fix a broken speedometer?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are dedicated instrument panel repair shops around most major metropolitan areas. They have the tools and experience to get the job done right and quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How much does it cost to repair a speedometer that&#8217;s not working?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The repair cost for a speedometer that&#8217;s not working is usually between $150-$400 to repair the instrument panel. A VSS is generally under $100 for the part.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can I still drive my Silhouette with a broken speedometer?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It should be fine to drive your Silhouette without the speedometer. If the VSS is bad and the engine is stalling at low speed, you may need to repair it right away. Otherwise, you&#8217;re just giving up knowing your van&#8217;s speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-base-2-background-color has-background\"><strong>Several apps use your smartphone&#8217;s GPS to give you speed data until you can repair your Silhouette&#8217;s speedometer.
