The most obvious symptom of an oil leak is the little puddle of oil or the dots that you&#8217;ll find under your Hilux. &nbsp;Transmission fluid and power steering fluid could also have leaked. &nbsp;Check all of their levels. &nbsp;If the power steering fluid looks low or foamy, it may be a power steering leak that you are actually looking at. &nbsp;If the fluid on the garage is red in color (which is almost always the <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/what-color-is-transmission-fluid\/\">color of transmission fluid<\/a>) it may be a transmission fluid leak that you are looking at.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Oil on Engine<\/strong>&#8211; The oil has to be getting out from somewhere. &nbsp;Before it lands on the driveway it will leak somewhere from your Hilux&#8217;s engine. &nbsp;Where it&#8217;s coming from is the question. &nbsp;We&#8217;ll go into that in the next section (it&#8217;s often the valve covers).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Smoke Under the Hood<\/strong>&#8211; If oil is leaking from the right spot, it can leak onto the exhaust manifold(s) and it gets smokey. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not nearly as flammable as transmission fluid. &nbsp;All it usually does is smoke and stink.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Car-Leaking-Oil.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-94764 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Car-Leaking-Oil.jpg\" alt=\"Toyota Hilux Leaking Oil\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Oil Leak Causes: &nbsp;Toyota Hilux<\/h2>\n<p>Fixing an oil leak means determining where it is coming from and repairing the issues. &nbsp;Depending on where it is leaking from, the repair can be very challenging or relatively easy. &nbsp;This is a list of likely places that the oil could be leaking from your car, and is presented in order from easiest to most difficult to repair.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Oil Filter<\/strong>&#8211; If the oil filter has been damaged or wasn&#8217;t sealed properly at the last oil change, it very well could be leaking some oil. &nbsp;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Oil Drain Plug<\/strong>&#8211; If the oil plug has been stripped out or was left loose, oil could be getting through it and onto the driveway.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Valve Cover Gasket<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;The valve cover gasket(s) are a very common place for oil to leak from. &nbsp;Depending on where exactly the valve cover the oil is leaking from will have an impact on other parts of the vehicle. &nbsp;For instance, if the oil is leaking from the valve covers above the exhaust, it&#8217;ll burn and smell as you drive. &nbsp;If the oil leaks from the valve covers <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Hilux-oil-on-spark-plug\/\">oil on spark plugs<\/a>, it can cause problems with the ignition system.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Oil Pan<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;The oil pan is a very common place for oil to leak from. &nbsp;Most likely, the gasket that sits between the oil pan and the engine block will go bad. &nbsp;But, it&#8217;s not unheard of for an oil pan to crack or get a hole in it. &nbsp;In order to fix an oil leak coming from the pan area, it&#8217;s going to take a lot of time, skill, and patience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>How to Fix an Oil Leak<\/h2>\n<p>If the oil leak is coming from your Toyota Hilux&#8217;s oil filter or plug, clearly replacing them is going to be the fix. &nbsp;If you do end up changing the plug or oil filter, just make sure to get new oil when you go to the parts store, since you&#8217;ll lose engine oil when dealing with either one.<\/p>\n<p>If the oil is leaking from the valve cover area, get the torque specs and see if tightening them up will fix the problem. &nbsp;If it does not, you&#8217;ll need to go ahead and replace the gasket. &nbsp;The same exact plan of attack will work for the oil pan gasket. &nbsp;But, of course it&#8217;s much more difficult to get down there and tighten these bolts. &nbsp;Be careful under your car and use ramps or jack stands. &nbsp;Never get under only with a floor jack.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Oil Leaking Toyota Hilux<\/h2>\n<p>It can be tough hunting down an oil leak, particularly with how tight and cramped today&#8217;s modern engine compartments are. &nbsp;Good luck figuring out where your Toyota Hilux is leaking from. &nbsp;If there is anything that you would like to add, please feel free to leave a comment below.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
