It uses this data to adjust the air-fuel ratio, change engine timing, turn the radiator fan on and off, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Circuit 1 &#8211; Low Input<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The voltage signal coming from the engine coolant sensor is below the normal operating range.  The lower the signal, the higher the temperature reading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nissan Pathfinder: P0117 Symptoms<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the most common symptoms of P0117:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Fail-safe Mode<\/strong>:  If your vehicle has a fail-safe mode, P0117 will usually activate it.

There are two ways to go with diagnosing P0117.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>If the engine is overheating, you need to determine why.<\/li><li>If there are no signs the engine is overheating, it&#8217;s time to determine if the sensor is bad or not.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Overheating<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Radiator-Fan-Not-Working.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Radiator-Fan-Not-Working.png\" alt=\"P0117 Fix\" class=\"wp-image-88176\"\/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The cooling system of a vehicle is relatively simple.  Here are the most common reasons your Nissan Pathfinder can overheat:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Low Coolant<\/strong>:  Check the overflow tank.  If it&#8217;s empty, fill it up.  Don&#8217;t fill a radiator when it&#8217;s hot.  Running a hot engine with cold fluid can cause problems.  Taking the radiator cap off with a hot engine can melt your face with steam.<\/li><li><strong>Bad Thermostat Or Water Pump<\/strong>: Feel the radiator hoses if the engine is overheating.  If they don&#8217;t feel hot, that would indicate that coolant isn&#8217;t cycling through the engine.  A bad thermostat or water pump can cause this.<\/li><li><strong>Leaks<\/strong>: Look under the vehicle.  Is there coolant leaking anywhere?   You can usually see where a leak is even if it&#8217;s dry.  There&#8217;ll be a white chalky buildup where it&#8217;s been leaking if it has been leaking for a while.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For more on overheating, check out our guide to reasons <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Nissan-Pathfinder-overheating-symptoms-causes\/\">why your Nissan Pathfinder is overheating<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Engine Not Overheating P0117 Diagnosis<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to go about diagnosing P0117, assuming that your Nissan Pathfinder does not appear to be overheating:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Compare the IAT Temp Versus the ECT Temperatures When Cold<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have access to a good scan tool, you can quickly determine if your ECT is bad or not by comparing it to the IAT sensor readings.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When your Pathfinder&#8217;s engine is truly cold (think parked overnight), the ECT and IAT (idle air temperature) readings should be the same.  If the ECT shows a temperature higher than the IAT, the ECT will need to be replaced.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clear the codes, take it for a test drive, and see if P0117 comes back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Test the ECT Sensor<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If it&#8217;s reading an unnaturally high temperature, unplug it.  If the temp goes to the negative digits, that would indicate that the circuit is okay and that the ECT sensor needs replacing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After unplugging the sensor, if the temperature STAYS high, you&#8217;ll need to look at the wiring harness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Check the Wiring Harness for Wiring Issues<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve unplugged your Pathfinder&#8217;s ECT sensor and the temperature reading stayed high, it&#8217;s time to inspect the wiring harness.  Look for wiring that has been damaged, frayed, or burnt. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ECT harness connection may be damaged.  Make sure that the pins look like they are in good shape.  The ECT&#8217;s proximity to the hot exhaust will give it a rougher life than many sensors, and damage to the harness is a common cause of P0117.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check that the voltage going from the PCM is correct.  On most vehicles, it&#8217;s 5 volts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Bad PCM<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible (but not probable) that the PCM has gone bad.  Take it to a skilled mechanic for diagnosis before you go down this avenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>P0117  in the Nissan Pathfinder is most likely caused by a bad ECT sensor or wiring issue. However, it can also occur if the vehicle overheats.
