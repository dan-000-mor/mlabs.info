On most scanners, it won\u2019t even register as a code. Its job is to tell the scanner that there are currently no diagnostic trouble codes stored within your G5&#8217;s ECU. Since it comes up like a code, the scanner can verify it has accessed the right part of the memory. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not a Pontiac-specific DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code); it is generic (it has the same definition for all cars or trucks with OBD2, no matter the make or model).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Symptoms<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are rarely symptoms associated with <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0000\/\">P0000<\/a>. Your G5&#8217;s check engine light shouldn\u2019t be on if it\u2019s the only code stored in the ECU:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Check Engine Light (MIL)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis.png\" alt=\"Pontiac G5 P0000 Symptoms\" class=\"wp-image-87467\" width=\"163\" height=\"163\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 163px) 100vw, 163px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>P0000 is stored in the system memory to instruct the scanning device that no other codes are present. Displaying it as a code lets the scanner know the memory bank with stored codes was accessed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The malfunction indicator lamp should not be on. <strong>If it is on, try another scan tool<\/strong>. P0000 by itself should not turn on the check engine light, so there should be other codes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Drivability Issues<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Pontiac G5 should run and drive fine when P0000 appears by itself. If there&nbsp;are drivability issues, try using another scanner to access the trouble codes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>P0000 Causes: Pontiac G5<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two scenarios when you encounter P0000. Either there is nothing wrong with your G5 (most likely), or your scan tool isn\u2019t picking up the stored codes.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to tell if there is something wrong is to look at the check engine light:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If the check engine light is not on, your code reader falls back to P0000 as a default.<\/li><li>If the check engine light is on, the code reader is having trouble accessing the stored codes.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common cause of this code is using a scan tool incompatible with your car. Any OBD2 scanner should be able to pull codes properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Scenario 1: No Check Engine Light<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/OBD2-Scanners.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/OBD2-Scanners.jpg\" alt=\"P0000 Fix Pontiac G5\" class=\"wp-image-279520\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/OBD2-Scanners.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/OBD2-Scanners-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/OBD2-Scanners-768x510.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Pontiac G5&#8217;s check engine light is not on, and the only code your scan tool pulls up is P0000, there\u2019s nothing to worry about. Most scan tools won\u2019t even mention P0000, and it looks like yours does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Scenario 2: Check Engine Light On<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the check engine light is on, codes should be stored in there other than P0000. If you can\u2019t access them, try using a different scanner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do get other codes with this one, deal with them. P0000 will take care of itself after you fix what\u2019s causing them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>P0000 Fix<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is nothing to do when you encounter this code by itself. If your G5 is running well and the check engine light is off, there is nothing to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other codes are stored in the ECU\u2019s memory if the check engine light is on. You\u2019ll need to get a scan tool that is compatible with your G5 in order to pull the other DTCs (Diagnostic Trouble Codes).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take it to the local parts store if you can\u2019t get your scanner to play nice with your vehicle. Most of them use solid scan devices that should not have any compatibility issues with your car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Related Codes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no codes related to P0000, and there is nothing to repair when it\u2019s the only code you see when plugging a scanner in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>P0000 in the Pontiac G5 is never a problem by itself. If the check engine light isn&#8217;t on, it&#8217;s nothing to worry about. If it is on, you&#8217;ll need to use a different scanner to access the codes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>P0000 is a rare OBD2 fault code that can affect the Pontiac G5.
