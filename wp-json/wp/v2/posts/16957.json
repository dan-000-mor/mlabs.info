This allows for a more efficient cam profile at any speed. This increases both engine efficiency and power.<\/p>\n<p>Camshaft Position Actuators change the lift of the camshaft up to 25 degrees. They are hydraulic, which means that they use the vehicle&#8217;s engine oil to control lift. So, if you have low oil pressure or dirty oil, it can keep them from doing their job properly, and trigger P0010.<\/p>\n<p>When these camshaft actuators go bad, the engine will no longer be able to properly change the valve timing and there may be a noticeable loss of fuel economy and power.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Subaru Liberty P0010 Symptoms<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0010-Symptoms.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-3770 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0010-Symptoms-300x74.png\" alt=\"P0010 Symptoms Subaru Liberty\" width=\"300\" height=\"74\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0010-Symptoms-300x74.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0010-Symptoms-100x25.png 100w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0010-Symptoms-150x37.png 150w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0010-Symptoms-200x50.png 200w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0010-Symptoms-450x112.png 450w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0010-Symptoms.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>When the camshaft actuators go bad, they can leave the engine timing a wreck. Here are some of the typical symptoms of P0010 in the Subaru Liberty:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Poor Idle Quality<\/strong>&#8211; If the camshaft actuator fails while giving the engine aggressive valve timing, it&#8217;ll idle roughly.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Decreased Gas Mileage<\/strong>&#8211; Now the engine can no longer adjust its cam timing on the fly, it will no longer be able to produce optimal combustion which equals poor economy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lost Power<\/strong>&#8211; The engine will not be able to produce as much power. This is because the cam profile will not allow it run a performance power curve when you need more power.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Service Engine Soon Light<\/strong>&#8211; Most of the time, you&#8217;ll be able to feel or see one of the above symptoms, but if you can&#8217;t, the service engine soon light will still come on and let you know that something is wrong.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Possible Liberty P0010 Causes<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0010-Causes-and-Fix.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-3768 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0010-Causes-and-Fix-300x75.png\" alt=\"P0010 Causes Subaru Liberty\" width=\"300\" height=\"75\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0010-Causes-and-Fix-300x75.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0010-Causes-and-Fix-100x25.png 100w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0010-Causes-and-Fix-150x38.png 150w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0010-Causes-and-Fix-200x50.png 200w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0010-Causes-and-Fix-450x113.png 450w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0010-Causes-and-Fix.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>There are quite a few different things that can cause the P0010. Here are the most common causes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Engine Timing<\/strong>&#8211; If the camshaft(s) are no longer synced to the crank properly (such as if the timing chain jumped a tooth), it can cause the engine timing to be off enough to throw the P0010 even though it&#8217;s not the Actuator&#8217;s fault.
