Certainly anytime the service engine soon light is on though, it&#8217;s good to deal with it as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Kia Amanti P0457 Definition<\/h2>\n<p>P0457 is a universal OBDII trouble code. This means that regardless of which make or model of vehicle, the code will mean the same thing (Amanti or not). The code technically stands for:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">System Leak &#8211; Evaporative Emission System<\/p>\n<p>The EVAP system captures all fuel vapor from the fuel tank and sends them to the engines intake in order to be ignited in the normal combustion process. When there is a leak in the Kia Amanti&#8217;s EVAP system, it will throw the P0457 OBDII Code.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Kia Amanti P0457 OBDII Code Symptoms<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Kia-Amanti-1.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Kia-Amanti-1-300x160.png\" alt=\"P0457 Kia Amanti\" width=\"300\" height=\"160\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-49116\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Kia-Amanti-1-300x160.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Kia-Amanti-1.png 388w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>P0457 code will typically not be accompanied by any noticeable symptoms other than the <strong>smell of gas<\/strong> and the <strong>service engine soon<\/strong> light.<\/p>\n<p>You should particularly notice the smell of fuel around the fuel tank area or fuel filler tube.<\/p>\n<p>The EVAP system deals directly with fuel vapors. If these vapors are leaking from the system, you&#8217;ll often smell them faintly while operating the vehicle. But, it won&#8217;t affect the way the engine itself runs. The EVAP system deals with fuel vapor, and not the running of the engine in your Amanti.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Amanti P0457 Trouble Code Causes<\/h2>\n<p>There are many things that can cause the P0457 trouble code to trigger in your Kia Amanti. If your Amanti has warned you at all in the last few months that the fuel cap was off when it wasn&#8217;t, then replacing it would be a great first step.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the most common problems that will throw the code, presented in order (somewhat) from most to least likely:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Evap System Hose<\/strong>&#8211; The hose that carries the fuel vapor from the fuel tank to the intake manifold can begin to leak. This will cause the P0457 code. Look for either a tear or hole in it. This is one of the most common issues that causes the code.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Vapor Canister Purge Valve<\/strong>&#8211; One of the most common causes of the P0457 code is the vapor canister purge valve. It&#8217;s really easy to replace. There are a few clips that you need to find and remove.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fuel Tank Sending Unit<\/strong>&#8211; It is possible for the gasket that attaches the fuel sending unit to the gas tank to go bad. This can reduce tank pressure and throw the code.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fuel Cap<\/strong>&#8211; A bad fuel cap can cause the code to be thrown for sure. Often, you&#8217;ll get a message informing you that the fuel cap is off even when it is on. If you are getting that message, plus a P0457, it may save you a ton of time and money to replace the fuel cap and see if it goes away.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fuel Filler Neck<\/strong>&#8211; There is often a gasket where the fuel filler neck connects with the gas tank. This gasket can dry out, especially with vehicles that spend their time in dry climates. When it dries out, the fuel tank can&#8217;t hold pressure anymore.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>P0457 Diagnosis- Kia Amanti<\/h2>\n<p>A mechanic has a wide range of instruments at his disposal to diagnose what would be causing the P0457 in your Kia Amanti. Here are the most common things that are done to diagnose the code:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The mechanic will typically check to see if there are any other trouble codes. The more trouble codes there are, the easier it can be to diagnose a problem. That&#8217;s because when they appear together in certain combinations, there will often only be only a few conditions that will throw any combination of codes at one time.<\/li>\n<li>After ascertaining what trouble codes appear with the P0457, the mechanic will typically <b>inspect the EVAP system<\/b>. This includes the purge valve, line, and canister.<\/li>\n<li>The mechanic will inspect the gas cap to make sure that it can handle pressure. If you are getting a warning that your gas cap is off, even when it&#8217;s on, replacing it will more than likely clear this code.<\/li>\n<li>The fuel tank pressure will be checked and monitored.<\/li>\n<li>After for the checks and fixes listed above, the mechanic will perform two tests:<\/li>\n<li>A smoke test, and they&#8217;ll use a scan tool to confirm that the EVAP solenoids and valves are operating properly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a pretty good video on diagnosing these leaks from Scotty Kilmer, if you are interested:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How To Fix Large Evap Leaks On Your Car P0455\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Ru8A7aYCUM8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Most Common P0457 Fixes<\/h2>\n<p>Here are the most common Amanti P0457 fixes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gas cap replacement<\/li>\n<li>EVAP line replacement<\/li>\n<li>Replace charcoal canister<\/li>\n<li>Replace the fuel tank<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of all the items listed above, it would be wise to start with the gas cap and work your way to the fuel tank, since the gas cap is far and away the easiest and least expensive items to replace on here.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a great video on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QcK9ejiHBSU\">how to test your gas cap<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Good luck figuring out what is causing your Kia Amanti to throw the P0457 code.

You could have a fuel leak. Pay extra attention to your tank level and make sure you are not leaking fuel. We recommend taking it in and\/or dealing with it right away.<\/p>\n<p>If you feel like there is anything that you could add to this article, please leave a comment below.
