It indicates that your vehicle&#8217;s engine coolant temperature sensor is sending a signal to the PCM (powertrain control module) that is outside of its normal operating range (in terms of voltage).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While P0116 is generic (it has the same definition for any car or truck), it&#8217;s most commonly seen in Honda, Nissan, and Toyota vehicles.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common causes of P0116 are a bad ECT (engine coolant temperature) sensor or a bad thermostat.   There can be other causes as well.  We discuss this in much greater detail below in the &#8220;causes + diagnosis&#8221; section.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>P0116 Definition: ECT Sensor &#8211; Range\/Performance<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the definition of P0116 divided into its two halves:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/P0116-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/P0116-Diagnosis-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-252297\" width=\"295\" height=\"295\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/P0116-Diagnosis-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/P0116-Diagnosis-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/P0116-Diagnosis-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/P0116-Diagnosis-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/P0116-Diagnosis.jpg 1322w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 295px) 100vw, 295px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>ECT (Engine Coolant Temperature) Sensor 1<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ECT is responsible for telling the PCM the temperature of your engine&#8217;s coolant.  It uses this data to adjust the air-fuel ratio, change engine timing, turn the radiator fan on and off, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Range\/Performance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ECT is typically a two-wire sensor.  The first supplies voltage from the PCM.  The second is the ground wire.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the engine temperature increases, the resistance lowers.  The lower the resistance, the higher the temperature reading.  Here are the two most common scenarios where P0116 is thrown are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The engine is warming up, but the temperature reading is increasing faster than what should be possible.<\/li><li>The signal isn&#8217;t changing at all as the engine warms up.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Symptoms<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the most common symptoms of P0116:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Check engine light<\/li><li>Poor fuel mileage<\/li><li>Heater not working well (indicates a stuck thermostat)<\/li><li>Engine not running properly (stalls, black smoke, misfiring)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>P0116 Causes + Diagnosis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"P0116 Diagnosis\" class=\"wp-image-190153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While there is around a 50% chance that throwing a new ECT sensor or Thermostat in there and calling it a day will fix P0116, it&#8217;s a good idea to do your due diligence before wasting the time and money installing a sensor that you may not need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Compare the IAT Temp Versus the ECT Temperatures When Cold<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have access to a good scan tool, you can quickly determine if your ECT is bad or not by comparing it to the IAT sensor readings.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When your vehicle&#8217;s engine is truly cold (think parked overnight), the ECT and IAT (idle air temperature) readings should be the same.  If the ECT shows a temperature higher than the IAT, the ECT will need to be replaced.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the ECT temp reads much colder than the current temp, that would indicate that it is probably bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clear the codes, take it for a test drive, and see if P0116 comes back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Test the ECT Sensor<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unplug the ECT sensor.  If the temp goes to the negative digits (on a scanner), that would indicate that the circuit is okay and that the ECT sensor needs replacing.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a temperature gauge, it should dip all the way to cold.  A scanner is still more reliable, but sometimes you have to work with what you&#8217;ve got.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the temperature sensor reading is super high, that can indicate that the ground wire is bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If everything seemed fine with the ECT sensor, move it&#8217;s time to suspect a bad thermostat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Check the Wiring Harness for Wiring Issues<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve unplugged your car or truck&#8217;s ECT sensor and the temperature reading stayed high, it&#8217;s time to inspect the wiring harness.  Look for wiring that has been damaged, frayed, or burnt. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ECT harness connection may be damaged.  Make sure that the pins look like they are in good shape.  The ECT&#8217;s proximity to the hot exhaust will give it a rougher life than many sensors, and damage to the harness is a common cause of P0116.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check that the voltage going from the PCM is correct.  On most vehicles, it&#8217;s 5 volts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bad Thermostat<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Wheres-a-car-thermostat-located.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Wheres-a-car-thermostat-located.png\" alt=\"P0116 Bad Thermostat\" class=\"wp-image-1301\" width=\"248\" height=\"250\"\/><\/a><figcaption>A bad thermostat is one of the most common causes of P0116.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A bad thermostat can cause P0116 by not allowing the engine to heat up.  With coolant constantly cycling through the engine, the reading from the ECT doesn&#8217;t increase much and the code is thrown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good way to get a read on whether the thermostat is stuck open is if the engine has been running for a while, does the heater blow as hot as it normally would?  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bad PCM<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible (but not probable) that the PCM has gone bad.  Take it to a skilled mechanic for diagnosis before you go down this avenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>P0116 is most likely to be caused by a bad thermostat or ECT sensor.
