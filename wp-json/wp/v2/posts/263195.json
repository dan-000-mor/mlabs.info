There may also be a noticeable lack of power.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span style=\"color: #800000;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Air\/Fuel Mixture Issues<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Without a reliable reading from the fuel pressure sensor, your vehicle may end up with the wrong air\/fuel mixture.  If it runs too rich, you may get black smoke and <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0172-Toyota-Tundra\/\" title=\"Toyota Tundra P0172:  Fuel System Rich \u2013 Bank 1\">P0172<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span style=\"color: #800000;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Unreliable Idle<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>P0193 can be caused when the fuel pressure regulator is bad.  If the fuel pressure at the injectors is inconsistent, it&#8217;ll be really hard for your vehicle to maintain a steady idle speed.  This can lead to the engine dying when coming to a stop as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span style=\"color: #800000;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Poor Fuel Mileage<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fuel mileage can suffer when the air\/fuel mixture isn&#8217;t correct.  You may also notice the stench of gas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>P0193 Causes:  Toyota Tundra<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"P0193 Diagnosis\" class=\"wp-image-190153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the most common issues that cause P0193 to be thrown in the Toyota Tundra:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span style=\"color: #800000;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Fuel Pressure Sensor<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The fuel pressure sensor is responsible for telling your Tundra&#8217;s ECM\/PCM what the actual fuel pressure is.  If it goes bad (or if the fuel pressure really is out of the normal range) P0193 can and will appear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A bad fuel pressure sensor can force the vehicle to overwork the fuel pump, thinking that it&#8217;s constantly starving for fuel when it is not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span style=\"color: #800000;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Wiring<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wiring issues can cause P0193 to be thrown.  Take a look at the wiring harness around your Tundra&#8217;s fuel pressure sensor.  Does it look broken or damaged?  Is the connection to the sensor solid?  If it looks bad, it may need to be replaced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span style=\"color: #800000;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Fuel Pressure Regulator<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The fuel pressure regulator is responsible for making sure that the amount of fuel pressure that reaches the fuel rail is at a constant level (which will be less than pushed by the fuel pump).  If your <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Tundra-fuel-pressure-regulator\/\">Tundra&#8217;s fuel pressure regulator goes bad<\/a>, it can restrict the flow of fuel to the point that P0193 can be thrown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>P0193 Diagnosis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A good scanner can help you look at the conditions that were present when the code was set.  You can also use it to check the fuel pressure reading as you drive.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to manually check your Tundra&#8217;s fuel pressure if the reading seems off.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the manual fuel pressure reading is <strong>normal<\/strong>, then you know that you&#8217;ve got an issue with the fuel pressure sensor (or the wiring going to and from it). &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the fuel pressure reading is <strong>high<\/strong>, it&#8217;s likely the fuel pressure regulator causing P0193.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>P0193 in the Toyota Tundra can be a difficult code to track down, but should not be ignored.  Doing so very well could leave your vehicle stranded.  If there is anything that you would like to add, please leave a comment below.
