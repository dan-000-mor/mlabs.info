between 4L60E and 4L65E Transmission"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>What are the major <strong>differences between the 4L60E and 4L65E transmissions<\/strong>?\u00a0 If there were a one-word answer to this question it would be <strong>strength<\/strong>.\u00a0 The 4L65E is manufactured to handle more torque than its counterpart.\u00a0 They have an identical looking case.\u00a0 For all intents and purposes the 4L60E became the 4L65E when GM upgraded some key internal parts.\u00a0 If you are looking to get an older 4L60E up to the 4L65E\u2019s specs check out this old <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hotrod.com\/articles\/ccrp-0711-4l60e-to-4l65e-gm-transmission-conversion\/\"><em>Hot Rod<\/em> article<\/a>.\u00a0 It also increase the torque capacity of the transmission to a healthy 380 foot pounds.\u00a0 This change occurred in 2001.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Are they\u00a0Interchangeable?<\/h3>\n<p>The 4L65E was designed with the LS V8 engines in mind. \u00a0They are not directly compatible with the 4L60E because they use a different torque converter and input shaft. \u00a0The input shaft is 300mm vs. 298mm on the 4L60E.<\/p>\n<p>So if you are going to use a 4L65E make sure that you get the 300mm torque converter with it. \u00a0<strong>Unless you get this converter, they are note interchangeable<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>4L60E vs. 4L65E<\/h3>\n<p>Dimensions:\u00a0 The 4L65E has the exact same case size and dimensions as the 4L65E.\u00a0 They also bolt to the crossmember in the same exact spot.<\/p>\n<p>Wiring:\u00a0 Today\u2019s modern vehicles can be a bit more difficult to deal with than their olden days counterparts.\u00a0 You absolutely need to make sure that any part that you would be installing is going to be exactly compatible with the one you just removed.\u00a0 LS series engines have both their engines and transmissions controlled by the ECM.\u00a0 If you swap out a motor for another year or size, you\u2019ll have to reprogram the ECM.<\/p>\n<p>Gearing:\u00a0 They are geared the exact same way.\u00a0 They are both overdrive transmission with a final drive of .70 to 1<\/p>\n<h3>Structural Improvement of the 4L65E<\/h3>\n<p>The entire reason for the 4L65E\u2019s existence are these structural improvements. \u00a0It is stronger than the 4L60E. \u00a0Is it worth replacing a 4L60E with a 4L65E in a performance applications? \u00a0I would say that the improvement is not worth the swap. \u00a0Go with at <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/4l80e-transmission-identification\/\">4L80E<\/a> if you have the room for it, or alternatively, you can use built 4L60E. \u00a0The high performance rebuild will have the improvements that were made to create the 4L65E, which are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved with a more durable five pinion rear planetary.<\/li>\n<li>Hardened input shaft.<\/li>\n<li>Hardened sun shell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>4L65E Identification<\/h3>\n<p>Detecting whether or not you have a 4L60E, 4L65E, or a 4L70E is relatively easy when compared to other <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/\">GM automatic transmissions<\/a>. \u00a0The trick is telling them apart from each other.<\/p>\n<p>You can use the chart directly below to make sure that you have one of them. \u00a0Using the transmission pan for identification purposes is the easiest way to tell apart GM transmissions.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/4L65E-ID-Chart.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-924\"

nearly impossible with the naked eye, at least when it comes to detecting whether or not it is 4L60E, since they share the same case. \u00a0Although, on the outside they do have different input shaft, 300 vs 298 mm is hardly detectable to the human eye.<\/p>\n<p>If you are looking to get a 4L65E from a donor car, or are wondering whether or not you have it in your vehicle, look in the glove box. \u00a0There is a list of RPO codes in there. \u00a0One of the codes on there will be M32. \u00a0That&#8217;s the code for the 4L65E, just like how the 4L60E is <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/m30-transmission\/\">M30<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you are looking at the transmission itself, the M32 number should be listed on the transmission itself. \u00a0M32 is also a high performance version of the 4L60E, depending on the year. \u00a0It&#8217;s really confusing,<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>If you have the option to get either of these transmissions, you\u2019ll certainly be doing yourself a favor by getting the newer 4L65E.\u00a0 Just be aware that if you are looking to replace a 4L60E that is behind an original through LT1 (90\u2019s version) you\u2019ll run into compatibility issues with the bellhousings.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>You may also find these articles useful:<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/4l60e-vs-4l80e-differences\/\">4L60E VS
