In the Compass, OBDII P0430 is often caused by a bad oxygen sensor, but there can be other causes as well.  They are outlined directly below.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>P0430: Catalyst System Efficiency \u2192 Below Threshold \u2192 Bank 2<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>One of the most common trouble codes with all Jeep vehicles is the P0430. This code number references a number that is given to you when you plug your Jeep Compass into a OBDII scanner. It doesn&#8217;t matter which model you have, this OBDII code has the same meaning for all of them (1996 models and newer).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Jeep Compass P0430 OBDII Code Defined<\/h2>\n<p>Your Compass has at least two oxygen sensors, one before and after the catalytic converter. Among the many jobs that oxygen sensors have is they have to measure the emissions levels coming in and out of the converter.  P0430 means that the Oxygen sensor <strong>downstream<\/strong> of the catalytic converter is registering an improper reading.<\/p>\n<p>The upstream and downstream oxygen sensors should show different readings.  The computer wants to see that the catalytic converter has scrubbed exhaust emissions.  When the readings from the upstream and downstream oxygen sensors show similar readings, it means these exhaust isn&#8217;t being scrubbed and the vehicle will throw the service engine soon light (P0430).<\/p>\n<p>See Also:  <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0420-Jeep-Compass\/\">P0420 Jeep Compass<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Jeep Compass P0430 Code Symptoms<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/P0430.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4796 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/P0430-300x74.png\" alt=\"Jeep Compass P0430 Symptoms\" width=\"300\" height=\"74\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/P0430-300x74.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/P0430-100x25.png 100w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/P0430-150x37.png 150w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/P0430-200x50.png 200w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/P0430-450x112.png 450w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/P0430.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>There aren&#8217;t usually any drivability issues associated with P0430. For most people the first sign that anything is wrong at all is the service engine soon light coming on.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the typical symptoms that something is wrong when you have code P0430.  Often, when it is only the oxygen sensor is the issue, you&#8217;ll feel no symptoms at all.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mileage-<\/strong> May or may not suffer depending on how much or if the catalytic converter is clogged.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Loss of Power<\/strong>&#8211; It is a really strange feeling to drive a vehicle with a catalytic converter that is going out. Typically, they&#8217;ll idle ok and drive normal under a light load. Whenever the engine is put under a heavy load it&#8217;ll feel like it is running out of gas.

Here are the most common ones.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Oxygen Sensor<\/strong>&#8211; The P0430 codes is thrown when the oxygen sensors on both sides of the exhaust have very similar readings. When the oxygen sensor is bad, it can cause a false reading and trigger the code. If the engine does not exhibit any of the decreased performance associated with a bad catalytic converter, it very well may be the oxygen sensor (if you haven&#8217;t noticed the performance loss yet).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Catalytic Converter<\/strong>&#8211; A catalytic converter is responsible for scrubbing out as much pollution as possible from the Compass\u2019s exhaust. Over time, they can become clogged. Although, modern catalytic converters are supposed to last the life of most vehicles, it could be there is some underlying problem if it has clogged.<\/li>\n<li><strong>O2 Sensor<\/strong> <strong>Wiring<\/strong>&#8211; Over time, the oxygen sensor wiring can go bad. It is especially volatile since it is right next to the hot exhaust at all times. The downstream oxygen sensor wiring is especially volatile since it is so far from the ECM (more distance to travel.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Timing<\/strong>&#8211; If your Compass is misfiring or the exhaust timing is off, this can affect the gasses that are actually going to the O2 sensors enough to cause the P0430 code to register.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Exhaust<\/strong> <strong>Leak<\/strong>&#8211; If there&#8217;s a noticeable exhaust leak coming from the vehicle it can change what the O2 sensors register enough to throw the P0430 code.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Engine Temp Sensor<\/strong>&#8211; If the computer doesn&#8217;t know what the engine temp is it&#8217;ll keep the fuel mixture rich. When the fuel mixture is rich, the exhaust the O2 sensors see will be out of range and it could throw the sensor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Jeep Compass P0430 Code Possible Solutions<\/h2>\n<p>Often, the oxygen sensor is the cause of P0430. Specifically it&#8217;ll usually be the O2 sensor(s) on the downstream side of the catalytic converter.<\/p>\n<p>But, don&#8217;t be surprised if it&#8217;s not. It would be a good idea to check the exhaust for leaks first. You should be able to hear an exhaust leak easily underneath of the vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you have an exhaust leak, you&#8217;ll probably need to test the O2 sensors and\/or catalytic converters. Here are a couple of good guides to help with that.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NKsS6AELPuM\">How to Test an Oxygen or O2 Sensor<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kNXh1Lphzr4\">Test your Catalytic Converter in 15 Minutes!!<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Good luck figuring out what is causing P0430 with your Jeep Compass.
