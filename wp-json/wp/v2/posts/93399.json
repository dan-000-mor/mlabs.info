It doesn&#8217;t necessarily indicate a major engine problem.&nbsp; When there is oil on the spark plugs is usually caused by a bad valve cover gasket or O-Ring (overhead cam engines).&nbsp; There can be other causes as well.<\/p>\n<p>Any gas engine needs three things in order to achieve combustion.&nbsp; It needs air, fuel, and spark.&nbsp; When any of these three necessary elements is off, your Camry&#8217;s engine will not perform as it should.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The ignition system takes care of the spark part of the combustion equation.&nbsp; The spark plugs are the final stop in the ignition system&#8217;s process.&nbsp; An oily spark plug can cause the spark plug to not fire properly.<\/p>\n<p>If you do end up with <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/oil-on-spark-plug-causes-and-diagnosis\/\">oil on your spark plugs<\/a>, you&#8217;re going to need to consider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=spark+plugs+Toyota+Camry&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=a0a5ee54e6054921fc0a4b485e625500&amp;language=en_US\">replacing them<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Toyota Camry:&nbsp; Oil on Spark Plug Symptoms<\/h2>\n<p>When there is oil on the spark plug, it&#8217;s going to make combustion in its respective cylinder less efficient.&nbsp; Here are the most common symptoms of an oily plug:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Oily-Spark-Plug.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-93394 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Oily-Spark-Plug.png\" alt=\"Toyota Camry Oily Spark Plug Symptoms\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"><\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check Engine Light<\/strong>&#8211;&nbsp; The <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Camry-service-engine-soon\/\">service engine soon light<\/a> will often be on.&nbsp; This is good news, since you can use the trouble codes it throws to diagnose the problem.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Misfire<\/strong>&#8211; The number one indicator that there is oil on the spark plug is a misfire.&nbsp; Your check engine light could be on.&nbsp; If it is, get an OBDII scanner.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#8217;ll likely show a P030X trouble code, where the X represents that cylinder number in the firing order.&nbsp; Or, you&#8217;ll get <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0300-Toyota-Camry\/\">P0300<\/a> if you have a random cylinder misfire.&nbsp; Eventually, if the engine misfires enough, it can lead to a backfire.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Decreased Fuel Mileage<\/strong>&#8211; With the fuel burning less efficiently, mileage will suffer.&nbsp; It may not be a lot at first, but it will get worse as the plug gets worse.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Catalytic Converter Damage<\/strong>&#8211; Fuel that is not properly combusted will leave behind gasses that can and will hurt the catalytic converter.&nbsp; If the service engine soon light is <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Camry-flashing-check-engine-light\/\">flashing<\/a>, this indicates that the ECM reads that this could be happening.&nbsp; If the check engine light is flashing, driving your Camry could cause permanent damage if it&#8217;s not fixed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Blue Exhaust Smoke<\/strong>&#8211; When a spark plug is burning oil, there will be a blue tint to the exhaust.&nbsp; This is coming from the burnt oil.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Oil on Spark Plug Causes:&nbsp; Toyota Camry<\/h2>\n<p>Most of the time, oil on your spark plugs is going to be caused by a bad O-ring seal on the plug itself or a bad valve cover gasket.&nbsp; Here are the most common symptoms of oil on spark plugs:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Oil-On-Spark-Plugs.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-93393 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Oil-On-Spark-Plugs.png\" alt=\"Camry Oil on spark plug diagnosis\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Bad Valve Cover Gasket<\/strong>&#8211;&nbsp; Oil is pumped from the oil pan up through your Camry&#8217;s cylinder heads.&nbsp; The valve cover gaskets seal the valve covers, which are on top of the head.&nbsp; They are there for you to have access to the head.&nbsp; As they age, they can dry out and go bad.&nbsp; When this happens oil can leak out of the engine and into the spark plug wells.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Valve Guides<\/strong>&#8211;&nbsp; As an engine wears throughout its life, the valve guides can go bad.&nbsp; When this happens, oil can get directly into the combustion chamber.&nbsp; While, the combustion process can burn off a lot of this oil, eventually it&#8217;ll hurt the plug and it&#8217;ll get oily.<\/p>\n<p><strong>O-Ring<\/strong>&#8211;&nbsp; On most overhead cam designs, there is an O-Ring that protects the spark plug from oil from above.&nbsp; If this ring dries out or fails over time, it will begin to allow oil to drip onto the plug.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Piston Rings<\/strong>&#8211;&nbsp; Piston rings surround your piston and fill the already tiny space between the piston and the cylinder wall.&nbsp; This keeps oil from entering the combustion chamber.&nbsp; If these rings begin to fail, it can lead to oil on the spark plugs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bad Piston<\/strong>&#8211;&nbsp; If the piston runs too long hot, it can develop a crack.&nbsp; This crack will let oil through.&nbsp; When this is the case, oil on the spark plugs is almost never the only indication of the problem.&nbsp; There is should also be a lack of engine power and some truly horrible knocking sounds.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Getting oil on the spark plugs is always a sign of a problem with something other than the plug itself.&nbsp; Although, enough oil can ruin a plug anyway.&nbsp; Good luck diagnosing your Camry.&nbsp; Please feel free to leave a comment if there is anything that you would like to add.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;ve found oil on your Toyota Camry&#8217;s spark plug, it should be a cause for concern.
