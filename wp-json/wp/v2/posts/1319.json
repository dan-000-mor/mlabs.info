If you want more detailed info, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/4l60e-transmission-problems\/\">4L60E transmission problems<\/a> for help diagnosing problems that are specific to this one transmission.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Low Transmission Fluid<\/h3>\n<p>Before going anywhere with your transmission problem diagnosis, go ahead and check your Trailblazer for low transmission fluid. \u00a0Having low fluid is enough to cause all sorts of problems. \u00a0Including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overheating<\/li>\n<li>Shuddering<\/li>\n<li>High Engine RPM<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here is way more on <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/low-transmission-fluid-signs\/\">low transmission fluid symptoms<\/a>. \u00a0You&#8217;d be surprised. \u00a0Just take a look. If it is low, you&#8217;re doing further damage every time you hit the road. \u00a0It always makes sense to start with the most simple thing first.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Torque Converter Won&#8217;t Lock<\/h3>\n<p>If you feel like when you drive your Trailblazer and the RPM just seems to be a bit higher regardless of how fast you&#8217;re going, but espescially highway speed, it&#8217;s a pretty good indication that the torque converter is not locking.<\/p>\n<p>This is usually caused by a switch that strikes the brake pedal. \u00a0This switch is prone to going out on Trailblazer&#8217;s. \u00a0If you know how to use an <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2E1KOOP\">electrical test light<\/a> than it&#8217;s a very easy diagnosis.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the exact opposite how the break light switch works. \u00a0The switch breaks the circuit. \u00a0What that means is when you push the brake pedal the torque converter unlocks. \u00a0That way if the switch fails you don&#8217;t end up with the converter stuck in the locked position.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Limp Mode<\/h3>\n<p>Limp mode occurs when the &#8217;04 Trailblazers&#8217;s computer system determines that there is a catastrophic issue. \u00a0It&#8217;ll only allow the vehicle to go into one forward gear and reverse. \u00a0A lot of the time it&#8217;s cause by the computer not receiving <strong>any signal at all\u00a0from the transmission. \u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A good place to start with limp mode is to take a look at the wiring harness. \u00a0It plugs into a 4L60E on the passenger side above the pan. \u00a0Here&#8217;s a picture to help you get an idea:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/4L70E-Transmission-Connector.jpg\"><img

sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Once you have located the harness plug, make sure that it&#8217;s seated nice and tight. \u00a0If it is go ahead and take a look at the harness itself and see if you can find any wiring that looks like it&#8217;s damaged or frayed. \u00a0These trucks are fifteen years old now. \u00a0That&#8217;s a lot of time for the elements to do their job.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Wiring Harness<\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, a shorted out or broken wiring harness can leave your Trailblazer unable to talk to the transmission. \u00a0When this happens it&#8217;s more than likely going to enter limp mode. \u00a0It&#8217;s worth taking a look.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Slipping<\/h3>\n<p>If you feel like your transmission is slipping there are several issues that may be causing it. \u00a0Most of them involve a lot of money to fix, because they involve opening the transmission case. \u00a0If you feel like your transmission is slipping, it may be a good idea to <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/how-to-check-transmission-fluid\/\">check the fluid<\/a>. \u00a0You may get lucky and find out that you just need to top it off.<\/p>\n<p>For
