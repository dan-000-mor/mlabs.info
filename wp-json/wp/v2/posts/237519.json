The first part is the malfunctioning part on your Amanti, the second part indicates what is wrong, and the third part tells you where the malfunctioning HO2S is located.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HO2S <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The heated oxygen sensor measures the exhaust after it exits the combustion chamber.  The PCM uses this data to maintain the proper 14.7:1 air\/fuel ratio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Heater Control Circuit High<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The heated element within the oxygen sensor heats the sensor faster than the exhaust can on its own.  This reduces emissions by letting the fuel trim enter closed loop operation more quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Amanti&#8217;s PCM has detected that the heater control circuit resistance is outside the operating range set by Kia.  When this happens, P0052 is stored in the onboard memory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bank 2 Sensor 1<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/O2-Sensor.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/O2-Sensor.jpg\" alt=\"P0052 Meaning Kia Amanti\" class=\"wp-image-188616\" width=\"464\" height=\"231\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/O2-Sensor.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/O2-Sensor-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/O2-Sensor-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px\" \/><\/a><figcaption>Hopefully, your O2 sensor is this easy to get to.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>B2S1 is the location of the oxygen sensor.  Bank 2 is the side of your Amanti&#8217;s engine with the <strong>second cylinder<\/strong>.  Bank 2 related codes occur on V6 or V8 engines, so you&#8217;ll need to determine which side of the engine bank 2 is on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need help, we&#8217;ve written a guide to the <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bank-2-sensor-1-location\/\">B2S1 location<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sensor 1 is the first in line following bank 2.  It&#8217;ll be on or directly after the exhaust manifold.  It&#8217;s finding bank 2 that is the tricky part here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>P0052 Symptoms:  Kia Amanti<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There usually aren&#8217;t any noticeable symptoms for P0052.  Once the exhaust heats up, the O2 sensor should still be able to pull a good reading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Kia Amanti P0052: Causes + Diagnosis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"P0052 Diagnosis\" class=\"wp-image-190153\" width=\"689\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the most common causes of P0052 in the Kia Amanti, as well as a decent order to check them in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-check-the-wiring-on-bank-1-sensor-1\">1. Check the Wiring on Bank 2 Sensor 1<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CHECK THE WIRING HARNESS FOR DAMAGE since P0052 indicates a fault in the heated O2 sensor circuit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pay extra close attention to where the harness may have rubbed up against something or has been damaged by road debris.  Look for burnt, frail, or damaged wiring.  Wiring issues are a VERY COMMON cause for P0052.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at where your Kia Amanti&#8217;s oxygen sensor plugs into the wiring harness and see if there has been any damage to the pins or if the wiring harness is breaking at the pigtail. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the pins appear corroded, get some electrical contact cleaner and clean them up.  If they are damaged, you will need to repin or replace your wiring harness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2a-verify-the-o2-sensor-is-bad-swap-test\">2a. Verify the O2 Sensor is Bad- Swap Test<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-base-background-color has-background\"><em>This method does not work if Kia Amanti has P0032 AND P0052.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since your Amanti happens to be a V6 or V8 model, you can do the &#8220;swap test.&#8221; This test involves clearing the codes and seeing if the code &#8220;jumps&#8221; to bank 2.  It&#8217;s a great test because it&#8217;s foolproof and easy to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s how the swap test is done:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#d3e8fc\"><li>Clear the DTC codes with your scanner.<\/li><li>Swap the Bank 2 Sensor 1 O2 sensor with the Bank 1 Sensor 1.  It\u2019ll be on or right after the exhaust manifold.<\/li><li>Run your Amanti&#8217;s engine until the check engine light comes back on. <\/li><li>If the code changes to <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0032-Kia-Amanti\/\">P0032<\/a> (The Bank 1 version of this code), that\u2019s proof enough you need to replace the oxygen sensor you swapped.<\/li><li>If the code remains P0052, you\u2019ll need to continue pursuing your diagnosis, knowing that both O2 sensors are working fine.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2b-check-the-fuses-and-voltage\">2b. Check the O2 Sensor Heater Resistance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the heater element resistance.  This will for sure verify whether the heated element is bad or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is voltage at the heater circuit, you&#8217;ll need to test the ground for resistance.  If you find infinite resistance, you&#8217;ll need to repair the ground circuit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This video is short and does a great job of explaining how to test for this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How to Test Resistance of O2 Sensor Heater\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YzkBdPP8l2g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-bad-oxygen-sensor\">3.

It&#8217;s very unlikely that P0052 is caused by a PCM issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>P0052 is almost always caused by a <strong>bad wiring harness or heated oxygen sensor<\/strong>.
