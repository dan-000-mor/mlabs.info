Coolant Smell<\/h3>\n<p>The nose and ears are our best auto diagnostic tools. &nbsp;You can learn a lot about what is going on with a vehicle by what smells and sounds different. &nbsp;In the case of a bad heater core, the smell you&#8217;ll be smelling is quite sweet. &nbsp;It&#8217;ll smell like maple syrup or fruit. &nbsp;Really, it&#8217;s whatever your engine coolant smells like.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_131541\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-131541\" style=\"width: 240px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Leaking-Heater-Core-Symptoms.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-131541\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Leaking-Heater-Core-Symptoms.png\" alt=\"Nissan Patrol Leaking Heater Core\" width=\"250\" height=\"223\"><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-131541\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A typical heater core<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. Coolant Leaking into the Cabin<\/h3>\n<p>If you are able to easily smell coolant while driving your Patrol, you&#8217;ll probably find that your passenger floorboard is wet. &nbsp;A heater core that is slowly leaking will do damage to the sheet metal under the carpet.<\/p>\n<p>The heater core is itself is almost always located on the passenger side of the vehicle. &nbsp;Turn on the blower motor and follow the sound. &nbsp;They are always close to one another. &nbsp;Check the floorboard directly below the heater core and see if it is wet. &nbsp;If coolant is allowed down there for a very long time the floorboards can rust.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. No Heat<\/h3>\n<p>If your Patrol doesn&#8217;t have any heat at all, that can be a sign of a clogged heater core. &nbsp;It could also be a sign that you are almost <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Nissan-Patrol-leaking-water\/\">out of coolant<\/a>. &nbsp;If coolant can&#8217;t get to the heater core, it won&#8217;t produce any heat at all.<\/p>\n<p>In the case that the heater isn&#8217;t putting out heat, check to make sure that the coolant level is full. &nbsp;You shouldn&#8217;t need to pull the radiator cap off, just check the overflow and fill it up. &nbsp;If it&#8217;s bone dry fill it up and let the cooling system pull it in as the car\/truck warms up.<\/p>\n<p>It is also possible that the blend door isn&#8217;t opening or closing properly. &nbsp;Depending on how old and complicated the vehicle is, the blend door may be operated by cable, or it could be operated by an actuator. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not unheard of for them to freeze up and not work until thawed back out.<\/p>\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t getting heat at all, check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Nissan-Patrol-no-heat\/\">Nissan Patrol No Heat<\/a> article before replacing the heater core.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. Foggy Windows<\/h3>\n<p>Foggy windows are a sure sign of a bad heater core. &nbsp;When you turn your heater on with the heater core is leaking, it&#8217;s effectively acting as a humidifier. &nbsp;it&#8217;s not water causing the fog, it&#8217;s antifreeze.<\/p>\n<p>Antifreeze is harmful and can be fatal if swallowed. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not good to breath as a vapor either.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>5. Overheating<\/h3>\n<p>An overheating engine can indicate that the heater core is leaking. &nbsp;But, there are a lot of other reasons why a vehicle could overheat. &nbsp;In fact, if you are overheating don&#8217;t start with the heater core unless you are getting obvious signs from inside the vehicle. &nbsp;Make sure that the coolant is filled and start looking for a leak if it isn&#8217;t full. &nbsp;If it is full and overheating, take a look at the <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Nissan-Patrol-bad-thermostat-symptoms\/\">thermostat<\/a> first.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Bad Heater Core Causes<\/h2>\n<p>A leaking heater core is going to be caused by a crack that leaks coolant out, or it&#8217;s going to be clogged. &nbsp;When it is clogged it doesn&#8217;t have a leak, but it also won&#8217;t pass coolant and provide heat to the cabin.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Nissan Patrol Bad Heater Core<\/h2>\n<p>Good luck determining whether or not your Patrol&#8217;s heater core is bad. &nbsp;If there is anything that you would like to add, please feel free to leave a comment below.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the most common problems that can happen to a vehicle is a heater core leak. &nbsp;If your Nissan Patrol has a leaking heater core, it is not a breakdown risk. &nbsp;Although, it is necessary to make sure that the lost coolant is replaced. &nbsp;It can cause damage to the vehicle in other ways, &#8230; <a title=\"Nissan Patrol Leaking Heater Core Diagnosis\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/nissan-patrol-heater-core-leak\/\" aria-label=\"More on Nissan Patrol Leaking Heater Core Diagnosis\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[330],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/132011"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=132011"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/132011\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=132011"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=132011"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=132011"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
