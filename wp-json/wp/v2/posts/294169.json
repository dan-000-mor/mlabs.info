A loose wiper pivot nut can keep a wiper blade from moving if it has worked itself loose. Verify the nut is still tight.&nbsp; If it\u2019s loose, snug it down and see if that gets your wiper moving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If tightening the pivot nut did get your GTO&#8217;s dead wiper moving, be aware that the splines are probably at least a little stripped, and they might strip all the way out on something like heavy wet snow. If that happens, you&#8217;ll need to replace the transmission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Stripped Splines (Wiper Arm)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy to determine if your Pontiac GTO&#8217;s wiper arms have been stripped out.&nbsp; Look at the nut where the broken wiper bolts to the car.&nbsp; Now move the wiper up and down the windshield.&nbsp; If the nut stays put, the threads have worn out.&nbsp; If the nut moves with the wiper, there is an issue with the arm that connects the wiper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the wipers parked (turned off in the resting position), unbolt the wiper arm and inspect the splines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll need to look at the wiper where it slides onto the splines, are the splines still intact, or are they all chewed up?&nbsp; If they are damaged, you\u2019ll need to get a new wiper arm, which is a much easier repair than replacing the transmission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they look all chewed up, you\u2019ll need to replace them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Stripped Splines (Wiper Transmission)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/WIper-Snow.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/WIper-Snow.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-294019\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/WIper-Snow.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/WIper-Snow-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/WIper-Snow-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Your GTO&#8217;s wiper transmission transfers the energy created by the wiper motor to the wiper arms.&nbsp; With the wiper arm off, take a look at the splines.&nbsp; Turn on the wipers to verify that the transmission is moving the stem that the wiper arm bolts to.&nbsp; If it\u2019s not moving, jump down to the next section.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the stem is chewed up to the point that the wiper arm can\u2019t get a grip, you\u2019ll need to replace the transmission.&nbsp; This involves getting under your car&#8217;s cowl and is doable for most shade tree mechanics with a little experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Stem Not Turning (Linkage Issue)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A linkage connects each wiper arm to your GTO&#8217;s wiper motor.&nbsp; If the stem isn\u2019t moving, you\u2019ll need to determine where the linkage has broken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you get to the wiper transmission, put the wiper arm back on and move it up and down, and you\u2019ll see exactly where the linkage failed.&nbsp; Sometimes you can repair it, while other times, you\u2019ll need a whole new linkage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These were the 4 most common reasons why your Pontiac GTO has only one wiper working.
