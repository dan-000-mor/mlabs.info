Battery Capacity Diminished<\/h3>\n<p>Far and away the number one reason that your Sequoia won&#8217;t start in the cold is the battery. &nbsp;A battery has two different ratings, cranking amps and cold cranking amps. &nbsp;Cold cranking amps are the batteries ability to start turn the engine over when it is cold.<\/p>\n<p>Battery capacity diminishes with time and use. &nbsp;So it may have enough cranking capacity to start the vehicle when it is warm, but when it&#8217;s cold, it just isn&#8217;t enough to turn the engine over anymore.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. Wrong Battery<\/h3>\n<p>If you happened to have purchased a battery when the weather was warm, and now less than a year later it&#8217;s not starting your Sequoia, you may have purchased a battery that doesn&#8217;t have the cold cranking capacity that your car needs to get started. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This often happens when you have a six cylinder model, and you get the battery for a four cylinder. &nbsp;They don&#8217;t have quite enough capacity to turn over a heavier motor when it&#8217;s really cold.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_103699\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-103699\" style=\"width: 425px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/How-to-Start-Car-in-Cold-Weather.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-103699\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/How-to-Start-Car-in-Cold-Weather.jpg\" alt=\"How to Start Toyota Sequoia in Cold Weather\" width=\"435\" height=\"257\"><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-103699\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The battery is the number one reason why your Sequoia won&#8217;t start in cold weather<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. Wrong Oil Viscosity<\/h3>\n<p>If you put a heavier oil in during the warmer months, it&#8217;s not as likely to keep your Sequoia from starting. &nbsp;But, in the winter, it&#8217;ll make itself known. &nbsp;The heavier molecules in the thicker oil can keep the engine from turning over fast enough to start. &nbsp;For instance, maybe you bought 10W-30 when the manufacturer called for 5W-30.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. Water in Fuel Line<\/h3>\n<p>Condensation can build up in the gas tank as temperatures change. &nbsp;If the condensation finds its way into your Toyota Sequoia&#8217;s fuel line, it can freeze and leave the engine unable to turn over. &nbsp;If the engine is cranking fast, as though the battery is fine, this is a definite possibility.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>How to Start Your Sequoia in the Cold<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some tried and true ways to start your car in the cold. &nbsp;They are presented in a way that would help you troubleshoot a car that you may be sitting in right now in the order that makes most sense for getting you moving right away. &nbsp;Most of the time it&#8217;s going to be a battery related issue, so that&#8217;s what we are focusing on.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>1. Turn on All of the Accessories and Lights<\/h3>\n<p>This may sound counterintuitive when the battery isn&#8217;t working very well to begin with. &nbsp;What you are trying to do is give your Sequoia&#8217;s battery a little time to &#8220;wake up&#8221;. &nbsp;Once you do that go ahead and turn the key to the &#8220;on&#8221; position, but don&#8217;t start the car for at least 10 seconds. &nbsp;This gives the fuel pump plenty of time to prime the injectors. &nbsp;Now, go ahead and try turning the engine over and see if it&#8217;ll start.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. Warm the Battery<\/h3>\n<p>If you are at home, and aren&#8217;t in a rush, you can unhook the battery and take it inside. &nbsp;This will allow it to heat up to a temperature that&#8217;ll get the electrons in it moving. &nbsp;Leave it inside for a few hours. &nbsp;This can really help it crank the car over. &nbsp;Be careful handling the battery.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. Jump Start<\/h3>\n<p>Jumping the Sequoia will get it moving around again in no time. &nbsp;Jump starting utilizes the power from another vehicles battery and alternator to charge your battery and help the vehicle start right there on the spot. &nbsp;You don&#8217;t want to let the engine cool all the way down, as it probably won&#8217;t start on its own until it&#8217;s warm outside.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. Replace the Battery<\/h3>\n<p>You can take the battery into the local parts store to have it tested. &nbsp;That would be prudent before outright replacing it. &nbsp;You should look up the cold cranking requirement for your particular Sequoia&#8217;s engine and model year.<\/p>\n<p>You want to get a battery that can handle at a minimum what the manufacturer recommends. &nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autobatteries.com\/en-us\/how-to-choose-your-car-battery-replacement\/battery-cold-cranking-amps-cca\">Cold cranking amps<\/a> are a standard. &nbsp;A battery must crank for 30 seconds at 0\u00b0 with a minimum voltage in order to meet it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Sequoia Won&#8217;t Start in the Cold<\/h2>\n<p>If any of the battery related issues ended up being the reason why your Toyota Sequoia wouldn&#8217;t start, it&#8217;s time to replace the battery. &nbsp;If it warms back up outside, you may get a few good starts out of it, but its days are numbered.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Extreme weather can be very difficult on your Toyota Sequoia. &nbsp;If there is an issue it often make itself known when conditions are at their worst. &nbsp;When it&#8217;s extremely hot. it&#8217;s the cooling system that is put to the test. &nbsp;In the winter, the vehicle won&#8217;t start when it is cold. &nbsp; There are a &#8230; <a title=\"Toyota Sequoia: Won\u2019t Start When Cold \u2192 Diagnosis\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/toyota-sequoia-wont-start-cold\/\" aria-label=\"More on Toyota Sequoia: Won\u2019t Start When Cold \u2192 Diagnosis\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[263],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/104300"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=104300"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/104300\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=104300"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=104300"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=104300"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
