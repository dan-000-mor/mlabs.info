While your first impulse may be to think that there is something wrong with your vehicle&#8217;s starter (and it is possible), it&#8217;s usually caused by an issue with the battery or battery connections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Does This Article Describe Your Suburban\u2019s Situation?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When the key is turned, and the starter is engaged, the vehicle will shut down power to any system that can go without power for a few seconds, which helps funnel all available electricity to the starter motor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re hearing this sound while the dash lights flicker, it&#8217;s almost certainly a battery issue:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio\"><audio controls src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Car-Clicking-Wont-Start.mp3\"><\/audio><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Suburban makes a single clunking noise when you turn the key, and the dash lights go out but don&#8217;t flicker, this article can still help you. But you can&#8217;t rule out the starter in that scenario. You&#8217;d want to check the battery over first before moving on to the starter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is written assuming that your <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/chevy-suburban-wont-start\/\" title=\"Chevy Suburban Won\u2019t Start Diagnosis\">Suburban won&#8217;t start<\/a> and you don&#8217;t have much in the way of tools with you. So we&#8217;ll give you the easiest things to check first and move down the line in terms of difficulty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Loose Battery Terminal (Likely)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Loose-Battery-Terminal.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Loose-Battery-Terminal.jpg\" alt=\"Tighten Battery Terminal For Flickering Lights When Starting\" class=\"wp-image-274715\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Loose-Battery-Terminal.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Loose-Battery-Terminal-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A loose battery terminal can cause your Chevy Suburban to have flickering dash lights and a no start condition. If a terminal is loose, the electrical connection to the vehicle is bad, and the dash lights can flicker without it starting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to tell if the battery terminals aren&#8217;t tight. Wiggle them back and forth. If either one moves, it&#8217;ll need to be snugged to get your vehicle moving again. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If either terminal is loose, tightening it should get your dash lights to stop flashing and get your vehicle to start. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are stranded with your Suburban without the ability to tighten the terminal where you are, push the terminal down and turn it with your hand a bit. That can give it enough bite to get your vehicle started until you can get home and tighten it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.

If you don&#8217;t have access to a dedicated cleaner, you can soak the terminal in a mixture of baking soda and water for around 10 minutes.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Cleaning Car Battery Terminals\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/xRYIY-KAQVk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Bad Battery (Most Common Cause)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A bad (or drained) battery is the most common reason why your Chevy Suburban has flickering dash lights but won&#8217;t start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find that the battery was too low to start your vehicle, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the battery is bad. It could have a <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/chevy-suburban-battery-draining\/\" title=\"slow drain\">slow drain<\/a>, or the alternator could be bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few ways you can test the battery:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to Jump Start the Chevy Suburban<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are stranded away from home, you can see if jump-starting your vehicle will get it to start. If it jumps, you&#8217;ll know that a drained battery was causing the no-start\/flickering dash lights issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to jump your Suburban:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Jump-Start-Vehicle.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Jump-Start-Vehicle.jpg\" alt=\"Jump Start Flashing Dash Light Fix\" class=\"wp-image-274718\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Jump-Start-Vehicle.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Jump-Start-Vehicle-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"has-base-background-color has-background\"><li><strong>Connect to the positive terminals first<\/strong>: Connect the red jumper cable to your Suburban&#8217;s positive battery terminal, then connect the other end of the red jumper cable to the running vehicle&#8217;s positive battery terminal.<\/li><li><strong>Connect to the negative terminals<\/strong>: Connect the black jumper cable to your Suburban&#8217;s ground terminal. Then connect the other ground wire to a good ground source on the running vehicle. There&#8217;ll usually be a spot pretty close to the battery that&#8217;s labeled ground. Any engine or accessory bolt that&#8217;s clean will usually work fine. The ground on the running vehicle&#8217;s battery will technically do the job too, but there&#8217;s a small chance that hooking up this way can start a fire at the battery, so don&#8217;t do it.<\/li><li><strong>Do nothing<\/strong>: Let the battery charge for a few minutes.<\/li><li><strong>Start the vehicle<\/strong>: If it seems like it&#8217;s acting differently (flashing less or trying to start), adjust the jumper cable contacts and let it charge some more.<\/li><li><strong>Remove the jumper cables<\/strong>: Reverse the process.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If the battery or <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/chevy-suburban-battery-light\/\" title=\"Chevy Suburban: Battery Light On \u2013 Diagnosis\">alternator light<\/a> comes on after the vehicle starts, you&#8217;ll likely need a new alternator. Driving with either light on will eventually cause the battery to drain again and leave you stranded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Test the Battery Yourself<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test your Suburban&#8217;s battery with a multimeter. Here&#8217;s how to go about doing so:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"has-base-background-color has-background\"><li>Set the multimeter to volts.<\/li><li>Touch the red prong to the positive battery post.<\/li><li>Touch the negative battery post<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, you&#8217;ll see a battery voltage level. Without the vehicle running, the voltage level should be around 12.5 or so. Anything below that might not be enough for it to start. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a rule of thumb, anything under 12 is likely a bad battery. A bad alternator can cause a good battery to drain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Let the Parts Store Test Your Suburban&#8217;s Battery<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Autozone.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"336\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Autozone.jpg\" alt=\"Chevy Suburban Bad Battery Test\" class=\"wp-image-274720\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Autozone.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Autozone-300x202.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption>These guys will be happy to test your battery<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most local parks stores, such as AutoZone, Napa, Advanced Auto Parts, etc., will be happy to check your Suburban&#8217;s battery to see if it&#8217;s bad. It&#8217;s a big win for them because you can buy a new battery there if it is bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the equipment used, the process can take up to a half hour. So keep that in mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>(Less Likely) Causes of Dash Lights Flickering + No Start in the Chevy Suburban<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are things known to cause this scenario but aren&#8217;t as common.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bad Ground Wire<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Ground-Wire.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Ground-Wire.jpg\" alt=\"Flashing Instrument Lights Click when starting\" class=\"wp-image-274722\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Ground-Wire.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Ground-Wire-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Above, we discussed that a bad ground connection at the battery could cause the lights to flicker and a no-start condition. But, a damaged or loose ground connection can cause the problem anywhere on the cable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspect your Suburban&#8217;s ground cable for any obvious damage. Then, follow it to its mounting location on the engine block or chassis. Make sure that it is snugged tightly and there&#8217;s no rust underneath it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bad Starter Connection<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The battery cable that runs from your Suburban&#8217;s battery terminal to the starter can be loose at the starter. This is usually only seen after somebody has replaced the starter and didn&#8217;t tighten it enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The starter battery cable can also get heat damage from the exhaust if it&#8217;s run the wrong way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dash lights flickering and failure to start is a very common issue that can happen to the Chevy Suburban.
