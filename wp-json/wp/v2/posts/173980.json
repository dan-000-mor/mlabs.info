There&#8217;s a lot our nose can tell us about a vehicle with a few quick sniffs.&nbsp; If you happen to smell a rotten egg smell coming from your Pontiac Vibe, it is certainly a cause for concern.&nbsp; It is most commonly associated with a <strong>bad catalytic converter<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The smell that you are smelling is obviously not rotten eggs.&nbsp; It is hydrogen sulfide, which is a product of the sulfur in gasoline.&nbsp; When the catalytic converter is working properly, it converts the hydrogen sulfide into sulfur dioxide, which is odorless.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Rotten Egg Smell Causes:&nbsp; Pontiac Vibe<\/h2>\n<p>The smell of rotten eggs is one of the most common smells that a vehicle will make.&nbsp; It can describe a few things.&nbsp; But, this smell is most associated with a <strong>failing catalytic converter<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Bad Catalytic Converter<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Catalytic-Converter.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-167490\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Catalytic-Converter.jpg\" alt=\"Catalytic Converter Rotten Egg Smell Pontiac Vibe\" width=\"498\" height=\"469\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The catalytic converter(s) sits in between your engine and the tailpipe of the vehicle.&nbsp; It scrubs out the majority of the pollutants that your engine makes.&nbsp; There are oxygen sensors on both sides of it.&nbsp; These are known as the &#8220;upstream and downstream&#8221; oxygen sensors respectively.&nbsp; They report the exhaust gas levels as they enter and exit the converter.<\/p>\n<p>If the upstream and downstream oxygen sensors determine that one of your Vibe&#8217;s catalytic converters is not doing its job properly, it&#8217;ll throw the trouble codes <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0420-Pontiac-Vibe\/\">P0420<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0430-Pontiac-Vibe\/\">P0430<\/a> respectively.&nbsp; If you have this code AND the smell of rotten eggs, it is very strong evidence that the catalytic converter is bad.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Diagnosis<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check the Trouble Codes<\/strong>&#8211; When a catalytic converter has gone bad, they will let you know by throwing a diagnostic trouble code, such as P0420.&nbsp; If your check engine light happens to be on, take a look and see if you have a trouble code related to the converter.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Performance Loss<\/strong>&#8211; It is also worth mentioning that a catalytic converter that is clogging will eventually cause a severe performance loss.&nbsp; Your engine is a pump.&nbsp; Too much back pressure from a clogged converter can clog the pump, and cause your Vibe to misfire.&nbsp; It is common to see <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0300-Pontiac-Vibe\/\">P0300<\/a>&nbsp;if this is the case.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Usually this loss of performance will feel like the vehicle just runs out of go at a certain speed.&nbsp; It&#8217;ll still rev fine in neutral, but when you really need the power, it just won&#8217;t be there.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Overheating<\/h3>\n<p>Keep an eye on your temperature gauge if you smell rotten eggs.&nbsp; An <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Pontiac-Vibe-overheating-symptoms-causes\/\">overheating engine<\/a> can smell a bit like rotten eggs.&nbsp; It can smell like a lot of things.&nbsp; It really depends on what fluids are on and around it that get hotter than they normally would.&nbsp; When these fluids (oil, antifreeze, power steering fluid, etc) get hot, they can cause the smell of rotting eggs.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Burnt Clutch<\/h3>\n<p>If your Pontiac Vibe has a manual transmission, a burnt clutch can have a very strong smell of eggs.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the smell of the clutch disk burning up.&nbsp; A clutch that is at the end of its service life will begin slipping when it is being asked to move a lot of force from the engine to the transmission.&nbsp; When this happens, the RPM&#8217;s rise like you&#8217;ve released the clutch momentarily and it creates the smell of rotten eggs.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Wrapping Up<\/h2>\n<p>If there is anything that you could add to help the next person who has a rotten egg smell coming from their Vibe, please leave a comment.&nbsp; We&#8217;d appreciate it.&nbsp; Good luck!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the most undervalued diagnostic tools is the human nose.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a lot our nose can tell us about a vehicle with a few quick sniffs.&nbsp;
