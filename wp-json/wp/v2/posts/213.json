300hp build, it would be wise to consider putting a high performance kit into the transmission, or having a shop put a shift kit into it for you. \u00a0The issue with the 700R4 these days is that they have been out of factory production for over twenty years, so it&#8217;s really difficult to tell whether the core that you would be using to build out your high performance 700R4 is good or not. \u00a0If you are going to try and take a look at the salvage yard, you may be better off looking for something like an old Caprice ( as long as it wasn&#8217;t a police car or taxi cab) than a Camaro. \u00a0It&#8217;s really more about what kind of life the donor car lived, and how many miles did it have on it.<\/p>\n<h2>Buy a High Performance 700R4 Outright<\/h2>\n<p>This route is certainly an easier one to take. \u00a0There are all sorts of vendors on Ebay that can get you a 700R4 that&#8217;ll handle anything from mild to wild for a great price. \u00a0Although there can really be savings by looking at Craigslist. \u00a0Many projects that start with the best of intentions end up fizzling out. \u00a0This is your opportunity to come in and get any part for pennies on the dollar. \u00a0You&#8217;ll find the guy who&#8217;s wife has had enough, or maybe the divorce special. \u00a0It&#8217;s the kind of endeavor that really rewards both patience and persistence.<\/p>\n<h2>How to

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The 700R4 uses a locking torque converter<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The way to go about picking out a torque converter for not just a 700R4, but any automatic transmission follows the same guidelines and principals. \u00a0It really comes down to how radical the motor is. \u00a0If it is built to have all the power come in at the top end, it would be necessary to convert to a converter with a higher stall speed. \u00a0If it&#8217;s a stock motor the factory converter will work just fine.<\/p>\n<p>The real question to ask with a 700R4 is whether or not to retain the services of a locking torque converter. \u00a0Unless it&#8217;s going to be used almost exclusively for drag racing (which by the way you may wish to look at transmissions other than overdrive if that is the case) you may wish to go without a locking converter. \u00a0Otherwise, just get one that locks again. \u00a0Here is a <a
