after a certain speed. &nbsp;Maybe it&#8217;ll drive 20 miles an hour just fine, but after that it just doesn&#8217;t want to accelerate whatsoever. &nbsp;This can also be a sign that it&#8217;s not getting enough fuel as well.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. &nbsp;Bad Fuel Filter<\/h3>\n<p>A bad fuel filter will not let enough fuel into the vehicles injectors to support operation above a certain demand on the engine. &nbsp;It just can&#8217;t provide the fuel pressure. &nbsp;If this is the case, like the catalytic converter, it&#8217;ll feel like everything is fine until you hit a certain speed, and then it&#8217;s going to bog down again.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. &nbsp;Timing Chain or Belt<\/h3>\n<p>The timing chain (or belt) is responsible for keeping the upper valve train synced with the crankshaft. &nbsp;This is vital for spark timing. &nbsp;If the timing is off a little and the engine still runs, the timing belt <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/timing-chain-jumped-symptoms-and-diagnosis\/\">may have skipped<\/a>. &nbsp;If it has jumped too much the vehicle may not even fire.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. &nbsp;Vacuum Leak<\/h3>\n<p>Your engine creates vacuum as it runs. &nbsp;The amount that is created is carefully thought out during the engine design process. &nbsp;When there is too much vacuum, it creates a situation where air is not coming in and being read by the MAF sensor, which causes the car to run wrong and not accelerate.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Car Not Accelerating<\/h2>\n<p>As you can see, there are a lot of reasons that a car may not accelerate. &nbsp;Good luck diagnosing yours. &nbsp;If there is anything that you can add, please feel free to leave a comment.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When your car won&#8217;t accelerate, that is a serious problem. &nbsp;There are a few different scenarios that can cause this. &nbsp;Before looking into anything else, if your check engine light is on, get a code scanner and see what trouble codes are stored in the computer system. &nbsp;They can provide valuable insight as to what &#8230;
