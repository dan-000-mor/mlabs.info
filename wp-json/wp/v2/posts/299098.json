That feature is known as rear cross-traffic alert and turns on and off with the Corolla&#8217;s BSM system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\/Heading<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does the BSM System Work in the Toyota Corolla?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Toyota-BSM.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Toyota-BSM.jpg\" alt=\"Toyota Corolla BSM system\n\" class=\"wp-image-298965\" width=\"591\" height=\"403\"\/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The BSM system uses radar sensors to monitor the area around your car. These sensors detect objects that enter your Corolla&#8217;s blind spots and then alert you with an audible warning and a blinking light on the mirrors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, when reversing, the rear-cross traffic alert will sound if it detects any vehicles approaching from either side of your Corolla.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Toyota How-To: Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Cross Traffic Alert | Toyota\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/3b35Qc6lcV8?start=29&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the Toyota Corolla BSM Light?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The BSM light is a yellow light on your Corolla\u2019s side mirror that indicates the system has detected a vehicle in your blind spot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The light will stay on as long as a vehicle is detected. The BSM light will flash if you signal that you are entering a lane the system detects a vehicle in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When Does the BSM System Activate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">On most Toyota models, the BSM system will activate when the vehicle reaches speeds over ten miles an hour. By default, the system turns on every time you start your Toyota.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Do You Turn the BSM System Off<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can turn the BSM system off in your Corolla in two ways. Be aware that turning off the BSM system also shuts the rear cross-traffic alert off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Physical Switch<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Turn-BSM-Off.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"908\" height=\"514\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Turn-BSM-Off.jpg\" alt=\"Turn BSM Off Toyota Corolla\" class=\"wp-image-298966\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Turn-BSM-Off.jpg 908w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Turn-BSM-Off-300x170.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Turn-BSM-Off-768x435.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Here&#8217;s what a BSM switch looks like.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Toyota vehicles come with a physical switch. It\u2019ll be labeled BSM or have a picture of a blind spot. If there is a physical button, it\u2019ll be to the left of your Corolla&#8217;s steering wheel. However, most models don&#8217;t have this button.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Menu<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Toyota doesn\u2019t have a physical switch for the BSM system, you can still turn it off in the menu. Here\u2019s how:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select the gear icon in the steering wheel options<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Scroll to the BSM and Rear Cross Traffic Alert option<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Press OK to turn it on and off<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do you recalibrate the Toyota BSM system?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the event that your Corolla&#8217;s BSM radar system has an alignment issue, a qualified mechanic can recalibrate it with a scan tool. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t0qjrxXXWsE&amp;t\">Here\u2019s how to recalibrate the BSM system<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should only do this if your Corolla has been in a collision or you\u2019ve had to repair part of the BSM system. Otherwise, the BSM system calibrates itself whenever you start the vehicle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Toyota Corolla BSM Not Working Causes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common reason the Toyota BSM system fails to work properly is if mud gets on the radar sensor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Debris<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Toyota Corolla&#8217;s blind spot monitoring system is incredibly reliable. If it isn\u2019t working, you should check the radar sensors and make sure they are clean. Once you do this, you\u2019ll need to restart the vehicle&#8217;s engine, and the BSM system will recalibrate itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sensor Issue<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Toyota Corolla has taken damage where the BSM sensor is located, it\u2019ll need to be taken to a shop to be recalibrated.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is the BSM system?
