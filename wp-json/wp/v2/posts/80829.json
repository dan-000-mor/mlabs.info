Opel Insignia<\/h2>\n<p>The symptoms of bad fuel injectors are going to feel almost the same as a <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Opel-Insignia-bad-fuel-pump-symptoms\/\">bad fuel pump<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Opel-Insignia-bad-fuel-filter\/\">fuel filter<\/a>.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to check the fuel pressure at the rail before replacing injectors, otherwise you may end throwing good money after bad.&nbsp; If you do end up needing to replace the injectors, they are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=Opel+Insignia+fuel+injectors&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=838593a4835a7671a5574b425b947bca&amp;language=en_US\">somewhat affordable<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Bad-Fuel-Injector.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-80094\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Bad-Fuel-Injector.png\" alt=\"Opel Insignia Bad Fuel Injector Symptoms\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Bad-Fuel-Injector.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Bad-Fuel-Injector-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Dirty | Clogged | Unresponsive Injectors<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Difficult to start<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;When some of the cylinders aren&#8217;t getting the right amount of fuel, it can be very difficult for the engine to turn over. &nbsp;It my not even start at all.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Idle Issues<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;With a fuel injector that is not properly atomizing fuel properly, your Insignia is going to have a difficult time idling. &nbsp;It&#8217;ll feel almost exactly the same as if it had a <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-spark-plug-symptoms-Opel-Insignia\/\">bad spark plug<\/a>. &nbsp;That is to say there will be a sudden drop in idle speed. &nbsp;It may feel like the engine is about to die.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Emissions Issues<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;When the fuel is not entering the combustion chamber in the right quantity, the engine may adjust the air\/fuel mixture, which can lead to increased exhaust emissions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Loss of Power<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;Typically, as the engine RPM increases, you won&#8217;t be able to &#8220;feel&#8221; the engine misfire as much. &nbsp;But, you&#8217;ll definitely notice the lack of power.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Less Fuel Mileage<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;Your Insignia&#8217;s engine management computer is constantly adjusting the air\/fuel ratio and timing to get optimal combustion. &nbsp;When the fuel injectors aren&#8217;t working properly it can&#8217;t do that and fuel mileage suffers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Knock\/Detonation<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;Detonation can cause your Insignia&#8217;s engine to blow. &nbsp;This is certainly the worst case scenario. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t ignore an engine that isn&#8217;t running right. &nbsp;You&#8217;ll do way more damage in the long run by not fixing the problem now.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Leaking Injectors<\/h3>\n<p>A leaking injector can cause all of the problems listed above, as well as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thin Oil<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;When a fuel injector leaks, all of that fuel is not getting burned in the combustion chamber. &nbsp;Any gas that is not fired and sent out as exhaust ends up in the oil pan. &nbsp;When this happens it can decrease your Insignia&#8217;s engine lubrication to the point that it&#8217;ll lock up. &nbsp;You will smell fuel on the dipstick.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The Smell of Fuel<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;When your engine is getting too much fuel, your Insignia can&#8217;t burn it all. &nbsp;You&#8217;ll probably notice the smell of gas as you are driving locally. &nbsp;On the highway, there&#8217;ll probably be too much wind for you to catch it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Engine Locks Up<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;Once too much gas gets in the oil, the motor will lock up. &nbsp;If you have reason to suspect there is gas in your oil, do not drive your Insignia. &nbsp;Change the oil.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Bad Fuel Injectors Diagnosis:&nbsp; Opel Insignia<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Leaking<\/strong> fuel injectors are often caused by a bad a crack in their body. &nbsp;When this occurs they must be replaced. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If the injectors are <strong>clogged<\/strong> you&#8217;ll need to have them cleaned by a professional. &nbsp;When they are dirty but not yet clogged, you may be able to clean them with a good <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2lJ6yaU\">fuel injector cleaner<\/a>. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here is a great video from &#8220;Ratchets and Wrenches&#8221;
