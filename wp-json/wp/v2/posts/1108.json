This size difference means that they are not easily interchangeable.&nbsp; There are many cars that the 4L80E just won\u2019t fit into without modifying the transmission tunnel either by taking a large hammer to it, or by welding in a larger tunnel.<\/p>\n<p>Another difference between the 4L60E and 4L80E transmissions are the number of bolts on the pan.&nbsp; That would be the easiest way to identify them.&nbsp; The 4L80E uses a 17 bolt pan, while the 4L60E uses a 16 bolt pan.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>4L60E vs 4L80E Gear Ratios<\/h2>\n<p>Both of these transmissions have four forward gears and are overdrives.&nbsp; The 4L80E has closer gear ratios and not as much overdrive.&nbsp; The 4L60E\/<a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/difference-between-4l60e-and-4l65e-transmission\/\">4L65E<\/a>\/<a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/4l70e\/\">4L70E<\/a> all share the same basic design and have the same gearing.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"156\"><strong>Gear<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"156\"><strong>4L60E\/4L65E\/4L70E<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"156\"><strong>4L80E<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"156\">First<\/td>\n<td width=\"156\">3.06<\/td>\n<td width=\"156\">2.48<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"156\">Second<\/td>\n<td width=\"156\">1.62<\/td>\n<td width=\"156\">1.48<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"156\">Third<\/td>\n<td width=\"156\">1.00<\/td>\n<td width=\"156\">1.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"156\">Fourth<\/td>\n<td width=\"156\">0.7<\/td>\n<td width=\"156\">.75<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you were to put the 4L80E behind an engine that already had the the 4L60E, it\u2019s going to feel more sluggish on take off and have a higher highway RPM.&nbsp; It was designed to keep the engine more in the power band for towing and heavy duty applications.&nbsp; In fact, it has the same gear ratios as the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/th400\/\">TH400<\/a>, minus the overdrive.&nbsp; It\u2019s also significantly closer in ratios to the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/turbo-hydramatic-350\/th350-transmission-identification\/\">TH350<\/a> (again no overdrive) and <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/2004r\/\">2004R<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Similarities Between the Transmissions<\/h2>\n<p>Both transmissions are electronically controlled and can\u2019t be bolted behind a first generation small block Chevy without a dedicated transmission controller.&nbsp; If you are looking to put a 4L80E behind a big horsepower non LS engine you\u2019d be better served with ordering a 700R4 that is built to handle a lot of horsepower.&nbsp; They can.&nbsp; You won\u2019t have to beat your tunnel to death, and order an expensive new crossmember (or fabricate one).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>4L60E to 4L80E Swap<\/h2>\n<p>They both have the same bellhousing bolt patterns and will hook to the same engines with no problem.&nbsp; So, if you are interested in doing the 4L60E to 4L80E swap, it will technically bolt up to your engine.&nbsp; It will be a lot easier to do the swap if you know that your vehicle can take the 4L80e without much in the way of modification.<\/p>\n<p>If you are thinking of putting a 4L80E in a Sierra for instance, you know that you can do that because it was a factory option.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you are thinking about squeezing one in on your LS swap project 55 Studebaker, it would be smart to hit the forums to see what kind of modification will be needed.&nbsp; At this point, almost everyone has tried everything and put it on the internet.&nbsp; Benefit from the lessons they learned.&nbsp; Never go in blind.<\/p>\n<p>For more on the swap, see the <a href=\"\/4l60e-to-4l80e-swap-kit\/\">4L60E to 4L80E swap article<\/a>. &nbsp;It goes over everything that you would need in order to pull off the swap.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;4L60E vs 4L80E<\/h2>\n<p>Both transmissions are capable.&nbsp; From the factory, the 4L80E is more capable than its sibling.&nbsp; It is my opinion that there is almost no situation where a built 4L60E is not going to be the better performance choice.&nbsp; That is until you get to crazy horsepower numbers.<\/p>\n<p>You may also like&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/th400-vs-4l80e-differences\/\">Th400 vs 4L80E<\/a>. &nbsp;People that are into the 4L80E really love the TH400. &nbsp;It may be a good read for you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are many differences and a few similarities between the 4L60E and the 4L80E transmissions.&nbsp;
