Wheel Alignment<\/h3>\n<p>Wheel alignment is the number one reason why a car would start to <strong>pull to the right<\/strong>.&nbsp; All it takes is the right pothole or unexpected bump to throw the alignment off.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of geometry involved in adjusting the suspension back into place.&nbsp; An alignment shop is going to be your best bet.&nbsp; Most makes and models cost less than $100 for a good alignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Putting off an alignment after you start to notice your car pulling to the right will eventually cause your tires to start wearing unevenly.&nbsp; When this happens, you may need to replace the tires and get an alignment.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2.&nbsp; Uneven Tire Pressure<\/h3>\n<p>If one of the tires in your car is under or overfilled, it can cause it to pull to the right.&nbsp; Just because the tire pressure warning light is not on, does not mean that it isn&#8217;t tire pressure.<\/p>\n<p>Use a good tire gauge to actually check the tire pressure level.&nbsp; Each tire needs to have the same amount of pressure, and it needs to be the factory recommended pressure for each wheel.&nbsp; That can usually be found on the inside of the driver&#8217;s side door.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3.&nbsp; Brakes<\/h3>\n<p>If the brake system has begun to stick, it can force your car to pull to the left&nbsp;<strong>even when you aren&#8217;t braking<\/strong>.&nbsp; The number one reason that brakes stick is going to be a stuck caliper.<\/p>\n<p>When your brakes are sticking, they will often give off a smell.&nbsp; Stuck brakes don&#8217;t fully stop making contact with the rotors.&nbsp; This causes a lot of heat, which in turn causes them to &#8220;cook&#8221; for lack of a better term.&nbsp; This smell is often the same as the rotten egg smell of a clutch that is burning up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Investigate each wheel after driving and see if one of the brakes are stuck and causing the car to pull to the right.&nbsp; Remember, the nose knows.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4.&nbsp; Suspension Issues<\/h3>\n<p>The suspension components that connect your steering wheel to your tires will go bad over time.&nbsp; All it takes is one of them going bad and your car will begin to pull to the left.<\/p>\n<p>Suspension items that can cause the car to pull to the right include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ball Joints<\/li>\n<li>Rack and Pinion<\/li>\n<li>Tie Rods<\/li>\n<li>Steering Linkage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>5.&nbsp; Wheel Bearing<\/h3>\n<p>If one of the wheel bearings on the right side of the car has gone bad, it will begin to act as a brake that pulls the vehicle in one direction.&nbsp; When this happens, you need to have the wheel bearing replaced immediately.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It should be accompanied by a grating hum sound that gets louder as the car&#8217;s speed increases.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion:&nbsp; Car Pulling to the Right<\/h2>\n<p>As you can see above, there are a lot of problems that can cause a car to pull to the right.&nbsp; It is most often an alignment issue that causes this problem.&nbsp; You should check the tire pressure before doing anything else.&nbsp; Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When your car pulls to the right, it makes driving feel like a chore.&nbsp; Constantly keeping straight when your vehicle wants to be in a ditch is dangerous and tiring.&nbsp; Fixing a vehicle pulling to the right should be considered a priority repair. &nbsp; Car Pulls to the Right Causes 1.
