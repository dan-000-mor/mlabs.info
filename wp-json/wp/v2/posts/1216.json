that goes over the axle shaft right by the wheel.\u00a0 If it is missing or damaged, it&#8217;s a pretty safe bet that the CV shaft is damaged as well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Car Not Moving<\/strong>&#8211;\u00a0 For some people this may go without saying, but if your car is not moving when in gear, it may be a pretty good indicator that the CV joint is shot.\u00a0 Now, it&#8217;s no guarantee.\u00a0 It&#8217;s also possible that the transmission could be completely out of fluid (or pretty dang close.\u00a0 If that&#8217;s the case it may be prudent to read up on <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/low-transmission-fluid-signs\/\">low transmission fluid diagnosis<\/a>.\u00a0 \u00a0You may have completely missed them.\u00a0 Either way a visual inspection will tell you a lot.\u00a0 You should either see ATF everywhere or an axle that is no longer connected to a wheel.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Vibration at Speed<\/strong>&#8211;\u00a0 As the vehicle speed increases, you may experience a vibration.\u00a0 That&#8217;s a pretty common symptom that there&#8217;s an issue with the CV shafts.\u00a0 It&#8217;s also a sign that you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/axleaddict.com\/auto-repair\/BalanceOrAlignment\">tire that&#8217;s out of balance<\/a> as well.\u00a0 It&#8217;s a good idea to check your tire pressure and make sure that it looks like they have been wearing evenly before you assume it&#8217;s a CV joint.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>How to Tell if a CV Joint is Bad<\/h2>\n<p>One of the easiest and best ways to check if a CV joint is bad or worn out is to perform a visual inspection.\u00a0 One of the best signs that there is a problem with it is if the boot looks worn, ripped, or missing entirely.<\/p>\n<p>Also, look to see if their is grease on the inner part of the tire.\u00a0 This is a sure sign that the joint has gone bad.\u00a0 Once the boot is ripped.\u00a0 It begins to allow all manor of particles to get in there.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t find anything during your visual inspection, don&#8217;t assume that everything is fine.\u00a0 It may still be time to have a mechanic diagnose what has happened to cause the noise or vibration that caused you to Google this in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>CV Joint Failure<\/h2>\n<p>When you hear the signs that the CV joint is going bad, it&#8217;s important to heed them.\u00a0 Because when it does fail, it fails spectacularly.\u00a0 The car will be going down the road and all the sudden the RPM will skyrocket because the engine no longer has a connection to the wheels.\u00a0 This is usually accompanied by a thud and hard clunking as the CV shaft beats against the exhaust and anything else that it can hit.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Can CV joints cause vibration?<\/h2>\n<p>Yes, CV joints can cause horrible vibration.\u00a0 The vibration will get worse typically as the vehicle speed increases.\u00a0 Sometimes the vibration will &#8220;top out&#8221; at a certain speed and begin to feel better as you continue to gain momentum.<\/p>\n<p>If you feel a vibration though, don&#8217;t just assume that you have a bad CV joint.\u00a0 You could also just need a wheel alignment, or a tire could be out of balance.\u00a0 I would recommend looking there before assuming it&#8217;s a CV shaft, unless you feel some of the other symptoms.\u00a0 These are listed above, but include clunking when going around corners or oil around your inner tire.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What does a CV joint do anyway?\u00a0 A CV joint (short for Constant-Velocity joint) transfers power to the wheels exactly like a drive shaft would on a rear wheel drive car.\u00a0 The rub with a CV joint is that it has to transfer power at MULTIPLE ANGLES.
