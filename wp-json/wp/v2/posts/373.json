\u00a0 Many shops rebuild with a core system. \u00a0This means that you take your car in and they will swap it out with a customers transmission that they have previously rebuilt. \u00a0This can be a double edged sword. \u00a0While it makes your wait time shorter, you can be getting back a transmission who&#8217;s parts have significantly higher mileage than the one that was in your car.<\/p>\n<p>If you are the one doing the rebuilding there are a couple of things to really contemplate before diving in.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Are you very mechanically inclined? \u00a0This repair is not for the faint of heart, especially when rebuilding an automatic. \u00a0Hundreds of tiny moving parts make a transmission much less intuitive than looking at an engine. \u00a0Proceed with caution.<\/li>\n<li>Can you afford to have your vehicle off of the road for an extended period of time? \u00a0If you have a backup vehicle to use that would be ideal. \u00a0If you are going to attempt to rebuild your transmission you&#8217;ll not want to feel rushed. \u00a0There is a good YouTube video for everything. \u00a0Here is an example of one such video. \u00a0It&#8217;s a 4L60-E being rebuilt. \u00a0Can you do that? \u00a0Be honest. \u00a0The last thing you want is to pull something apart and never get it back together.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/EkyPoeAcxOI\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>New Transmission Pros:<\/h2>\n<p>If you are\u00a0weighing the options when it comes to replacing or rebuilding your transmission, and money is no option, than it&#8217;s really hard to go wrong with a new unit. \u00a0You don&#8217;t have to worry about another part in the unit failing and putting your car right out of commission.<\/p>\n<p>If you are installing it yourself, than it becomes a matter of whether or not you are comfortable pulling your engine and\/or transmission from the vehicle. \u00a0 Either way the repair is significantly easier than rebuilding. \u00a0You can bust this out in a weekend even if you don&#8217;t have a lot of automotive expertise.<\/p>\n<h2>New Transmission Cons:<\/h2>\n<p>A new transmission is significantly pricier than a rebuilt unit. \u00a0You are certainly paying for the peace of mind that comes with knowing that your transmission will provide you with years of trouble free service.<\/p>\n<h2>Extra Thoughts on Replacing or Rebuilding a Transmission<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Safety: \u00a0If you decide to do it yourself it truly is not a simple job. \u00a0Be safe! \u00a0At the least have someone to work with you to help you manipulate the thing. \u00a0Also, get the right tools for the job. \u00a0A good transmission jack can be very helpful in helping you keep your head from getting squashed.<\/li>\n<li>Junker Factor: \u00a0If you have a ten year old with 200k on it, it&#8217;d be a real shame to send it to the salvage yard with \u00a0a brand new, extremely low mile, transmission.<\/li>\n<li>Since this site is mostly about the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/\">700R4<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/\">GM automatic transmissions<\/a>, these transmissions were all meant for rear wheel drive vehicles and are not that difficult to pull and replace.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s a question that I hear about a lot. \u00a0If you don&#8217;t feel like reading a long in depth article on the subject, the short answer is it depends on what they do to the transmission during the rebuild.
