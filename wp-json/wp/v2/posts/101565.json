Armada<\/h2>\n<p>Here are the most common causes of blue smoke coming from your Armada\u2019s exhaust:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Valve Seals Worn Out<\/h3>\n<p>Your Nissan Armada&#8217;s valves let both air and fuel into the combustion chamber. &nbsp;They are lubricated like the rest of the motor. &nbsp;Valve seals are utilized to keep the oil from riding down the valve stem and into the combustion chamber while the valves are letting air and fuel into the cylinder.<\/p>\n<p>If your Armada&#8217;s valves are worn, you&#8217;ll see a hint of blue smoke while the engine is running. &nbsp;But, it&#8217;ll be at its worst when the engine is starting up, as oil has had time to seep past the valve seals while it&#8217;s sitting.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Blue-Smoke-From-Exhaust-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-101158\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Blue-Smoke-From-Exhaust-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"Nissan Armada Blue Smoke Coming From Exhaust Diagnosis\" width=\"400\" height=\"318\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Piston Rings<\/h3>\n<p>Each piston in the vehicle&#8217;s engine is responsible for compressing the air and fuel mixture into a smaller and smaller space before the spark plug fires.<\/p>\n<p>The gap between the cylinder wall and the piston is so tiny that you can&#8217;t get a piece of paper in-between them. &nbsp;On top of this, piston rings are wrapped around the piston for an even tighter fit. &nbsp;This keep oil out of your Armada&#8217;s combustion chamber.<\/p>\n<p>When the piston rings fail, oil passes through them and into the combustion chamber, and you&#8217;ll get blue smoke from your exhaust. &nbsp;This is most common in high mileage engines and is a sign that the bottom end has worn out.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>PCV Valve<\/h3>\n<p>Your Armada&#8217;s PCV system is responsible for taking the pressure that builds up in the oil pan and moving it to the intake side of the engine. &nbsp;It opens and closes, which keeps the intake free of oil. &nbsp;If it stays open, oil will build up in the intake, and you&#8217;ll end up with blue smoke coming from the exhaust as this oil is burnt.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Turbocharger (turbocharged engines only)<\/h3>\n<p>As auto manufacturers constantly push for better fuel economy, turbochargers have been finding their way into regular, everyday vehicles. &nbsp;When a turbocharger goes bad, it will allow oil to get sucked into the combustion chamber. &nbsp;Usually it&#8217;ll be a big plume of blue smoke as this happens.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Blue-Smoke-Frome-Exhaust-Causes.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-101159 size-full\"

(Diesel Engines Only)<\/h3>\n<p>Glow plugs warm up the engine enough for the combustion of diesel fuel when a diesel engine is cold. &nbsp;If one of the plugs has gone bad, it&#8217;s going to cause blue smoke until the motor has warmed all the way up.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Nissan Armada Blue Smoke Diagnosis<\/h2>\n<p>Blue smoke is different than <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/white-smoke-from-exhaust-Nissan-Armada\/\">white<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Nissan-Armada-black-smoke-from-exhaust\/\">black<\/a> smoke. &nbsp;They are caused by different engine problems. &nbsp;When you see blue smoke, you need to find out how oil is getting into your Armada&#8217;s combustion chamber.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>PCV<\/h3>\n<p>The first thing that you&#8217;re going to want to do is check the <strong>PCV valve<\/strong>. &nbsp;It&#8217;s far and away the easiest thing to check. &nbsp;Here is a really <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ffyXoBdkR7w\">great video<\/a> from YouTube that shows exactly how you would go about doing so.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Glow Plugs or Turbo Vehicles<\/h3>\n<p>After checking the PCV valve, it&#8217;s time to move onto the <strong>turbo<\/strong> (turbocharged vehicles only) or <strong>glow plugs<\/strong> (diesel only) and see if either of them are bad. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4Po_1pNHE1Y\">How to test glow plugs (YouTube)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Engine<\/h3>\n<p>Once we are sure that all of the easier stuff to check is not causing the blue smoke, it&#8217;s time to turn to the inside of the engine.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Valve Seals<\/h4>\n<p>You&#8217;ll want to check the valve seals. &nbsp;There are ways to get a pretty good idea if they are bad without ever cranking the engine over. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a

impossible) to get to without pulling the engine. You can learn a lot about what is going on with the valves, valve seals, and piston rings by doing a compression test. &nbsp;When done right, this can help you tell if the Armada&#8217;s piston rings are worn.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.popularmechanics.com\/cars\/how-to\/a8520\/cars-101-how-to-do-a-compression-test-14912158\/\">Compression Test: &nbsp;How To (PopularMechanics)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Blue Exhaust Smoke Nissan Armada<\/h2>\n<p>It can be tough trying to track down why you may have blue smoke from your exhaust. &nbsp;With a little patience, you can do it. &nbsp;If there is anything you&#8217;d like to add, please leave a comment below.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; A very common problem that affects all vehicles (including the Nissan Armada) is blue smoke coming from the exhaust. &nbsp;Reasons for blue exhaust smoke include bad valve seals, valve train wear in general, the PCV valve, burning transmission fluid and more.
