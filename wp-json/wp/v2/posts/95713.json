It has two main functions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cornering<\/strong>&#8211; Your Accord&#8217;s VSA system attempt to keep your vehicle going in the direction that you intended.&nbsp; In other words, it corrects any oversteer or understeer.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Traction<\/strong>&#8211; If your Honda can&#8217;t get enough traction, the VSA system will limit wheel slip in order to keep you in control of the vehicle.&nbsp; It&#8217;ll also lower the engine speed to accomplish this.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>VSA Light Meaning:&nbsp; Honda Accord<\/h2>\n<p>There are warning lights associated with the VSA system.&nbsp; They are:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>1.&nbsp; VSA System Light<\/h3>\n<p>The light listed simply as VSA is the system indicator light.&nbsp; If it stays on, it is letting you know that there is some problem with the Accord&#8217;s VSA itself.&nbsp; When the light comes on, Honda suggests getting someplace safe and restarting the engine.&nbsp; If the VSA light doesn&#8217;t come back on, you are good to go.&nbsp; If it does come back on, it is time to diagnose the issue, or take it in to the shop.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2.&nbsp; Triangle with Exclamation Point<\/h3>\n<p>This VSA light indicates that the system is currently activated, which means that it is actively helping keep your Accord safe.&nbsp; If this light stays on at all times, it probably means that the VSA system has been switched off.&nbsp; This is easy enough to do, there is a button that says VSA on it.&nbsp; Just press it and see if this light turns off.&nbsp; If it comes on WITH the VSA light, it indicates there is a problem.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-87467 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis.png\" alt=\"Honda Accord VSA Light Diagnosis\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Accord VSA Light on Causes<\/h2>\n<p>Just like with any other major vehicle problem, you\u2019re going to want to get a reading of your Honda&#8217;s diagnostic trouble codes.&nbsp; You can use a good <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2ZUmZmZ\">code scanner,<\/a>&nbsp;or you can take it to the local parts store and see if they will scan it for you.&nbsp; Most of them do.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll want to scan the ABS control unit, ECU, and steering control.&nbsp; If you do opt to purchase a code scanner, just be aware that the cheaper ones will often only read the engine.&nbsp; That\u2019s fine most of the time, but the problem causing the VSA light in your Accord could be in one of the other control units.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/VSA-Light-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-95706\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/VSA-Light-Diagnosis.png\" alt=\"VSA Light Diagnosis\" width=\"80\" height=\"86\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Steering Angle Sensor<\/h3>\n<p>The VSA uses the steering angle sensor to determine if the vehicle is pointed in the direction that you are asking it go.&nbsp; If it is not functioning properly, it will cause the VSA light to come on.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Wheel Speed Sensor<\/h3>\n<p>The wheel speed sensors are responsible for monitoring the wheel speed and send it back to the computer system. &nbsp;If one of the wheels is moving slower than the others, but not as slow or fast as it should in relation to the steering angle, the VSA system will step in and correct the vehicle.<\/p>\n<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic=\"true\">When this sensor is no longer sending a signal to your Honda&#8217;s VSA system, it is no longer functioning properly and the VSA light will be activated (typically the ABS light will as well).<\/p>\n<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic=\"true\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>ABS Module<\/h3>\n<p>The VSA system is run through the ABS System, which means that it can be the ABS module that causes the Accord&#8217;s VSA light to come on.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion:<\/h2>\n<p>More than most auto repair diagnostic issues, figuring out why the VSA light is staying on can be tricky.&nbsp; A good code scanner is essential.&nbsp; Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your Honda Accord is designed with a (Vehicle Stability Assist) system which keeps you safe when driving conditions are hazardous.&nbsp;
