It also throws the code P0171 to let you know that it has done this.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>Sequoia P0171 Code Symptoms<\/h2>\n<p>The <strong>P0171 code<\/strong> on a <strong>Toyota Sequoia<\/strong> will often be thrown if the fuel injection system is not operating properly.

Here are the most common ones.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vacuum Leaks<\/strong>&#8211; With the Toyota Sequoia, one of the most common cause for the P0171 code to show is a vacuum leak. Take a look around and see if you can find the vacuum leak. Here&#8217;s a great YouTube video on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9CPqbaSgcok\">how to find a vacuum leak<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Oxygen Sensor<\/strong>&#8211; The P0171 codes is thrown when the oxygen sensor(s) do not register enough oxygen in the exhaust. When the oxygen sensor is bad, it can cause a false reading and trigger the code. The computer will still adjust the air\/fuel mixture to compensate. This will cause the Sequoia to run rich.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mass Air Flow Sensor<\/strong>&#8211; The mass air flow sensor calculates the volume of air entering the engine. If it has gone bad, the air fuel mixture will be off and the P0171 code will show.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bad Fuel Injectors<\/strong>&#8211; If you have one or more fuel injectors that have gone bad that can certainly cause the air\/fuel mixture to go bad.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fuel Pump\/Fuel Filter<\/strong>&#8211; Today&#8217;s modern fuel injected motors need a lot of fuel pressure to atomize the gas properly. If the <strong>fuel pressure<\/strong> is not as high as it needs to be this atomization doesn&#8217;t happen properly and the optimal air\/fuel mixture isn&#8217;t achieved.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Air Filter<\/strong>&#8211; While it&#8217;s not the most common reason to throw the P0171 code, a clogged air filter certainly can cause the code to throw. And, since it&#8217;s so easy to check, why not look?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Good luck figuring out what is wrong with your Sequoia.
