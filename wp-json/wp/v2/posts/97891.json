Accelerate: &nbsp;RPMS Go Up<\/h2>\n<p>If your Ameo <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/car-wont-accelerate-causes\/\">won&#8217;t accelerate<\/a>, but the RPM&#8217;s go up it&#8217;s usually not going to be an engine related issue. &nbsp;Somehow, the power that your engine is creating is not making it to the rear wheels. &nbsp;This is typically a transmission related issue.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the most common cause of acceleration with the RPM&#8217;s going up:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>1. &nbsp;Transmission Fluid Low<\/h3>\n<p>If your Ameo is too low on transmission fluid, it&#8217;ll will no longer be able to transfer power to the rear wheels. &nbsp;The power goes to the torque converter, and that&#8217;s the end of the line. &nbsp;You should check the transmission fluid immediately. &nbsp;This is the number one cause of not accelerating but the RPM&#8217;s Go up.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/low-transmission-fluid-signs\/\">Low Transmission Fluid Signs<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. &nbsp;Bad torque converter<\/h3>\n<p>The torque converter is responsible for taking the mechanical power of the engine and converting it into hydraulic power. &nbsp;If the torque converter has gone bad, it will no longer be able to do this job. &nbsp;No power can get to the transmission.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-torque-converter-vs-bad-transmission\/\">Bad Torque Converter vs Bad Transmission<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. &nbsp;Drivetrain No Longer Connected to Wheels<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve broken a drive\/axle shaft, your Volkswagen Ameo&#8217;s transmission has no way to turn the wheels anymore. &nbsp;If this were the case, there would not be any movement whatsoever from the vehicle. &nbsp;You also wouldn&#8217;t feel the slight jerk your Ameo as you put it into gear.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. &nbsp;Bad Transmission<\/h3>\n<p>If something has gone wrong in the transmission, your Ameo may not be able to accelerate any more. &nbsp;If it can no longer shift, it could be caused by a solenoid\/valve body has gone bad, clutch packs, debris, and much more. &nbsp;Automatic transmission are very complicated.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>5. &nbsp;Clutch<\/h3>\n<p>Although the manual transmission is going away, if you happen to have a Ameo equipped with one, a bad clutch can cause it not to accelerate. &nbsp;The clutch is responsible for making a direct connection between the engine (via the flywheel) and the transmission (via the input shaft).<\/p>\n<p>When the clutch can&#8217;t hold on anymore, it&#8217;ll start to slip. &nbsp;Slipping means that it loses its grip on the flywheel and it feels like you&#8217;ve pushed the clutch in. &nbsp;This will usually happen at highway speed, under heavy acceleration. &nbsp;It only gets worse as the clutch disk slips, burns up, and can handle less and less torque. &nbsp;Eventually it&#8217;ll only move in first gear or not at all.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Ameo Won&#8217;t Accelerate: &nbsp;RPMS Stays Put<\/h2>\n<h3><a

accelerate, but the RPM&#8217;s do not change, that is an indication that there is an issue with creating power. &nbsp;The issue is going to be something affecting the motor.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some common issues that can affect the motor:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>1. &nbsp;Clogged Catalytic Converter<\/h3>\n<p>If the catalytic converter gets too clogged up, it&#8217;ll keep the motor from accelerating properly. &nbsp;It&#8217;ll &#8220;bog&#8221; after a certain speed. &nbsp;Maybe it&#8217;ll drive 20 miles an hour just fine, but after that it just doesn&#8217;t want to accelerate whatsoever. &nbsp;This can also be a sign that it&#8217;s not getting enough fuel as well.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Volkswagen-Ameo-catalytic-converter\/\">Volkswagen-Ameo Catalytic Converter Diagnosis<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. &nbsp;Bad Fuel Filter<\/h3>\n<p>A bad fuel filter will not let enough fuel into the Ameos fuel injection system to support operation above a certain demand on the engine. &nbsp;It just can&#8217;t provide the fuel pressure. &nbsp;If this is the case, like the catalytic converter, it&#8217;ll feel like everything is fine until you hit a certain speed, and then it&#8217;s going to bog down again.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Volkswagen-Ameo-bad-fuel-filter\/\">Volkswagen Ameo: Bad Fuel Filter \u2192 Symptoms and Diagnosis<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. &nbsp;Timing Chain or Belt<\/h3>\n<p>The timing chain (or belt) is responsible for keeping the upper valve train synced with the crankshaft. &nbsp;This is vital for spark timing. &nbsp;If the timing is off a little and the engine still runs, the timing belt <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/timing-chain-jumped-symptoms-and-diagnosis\/\">may have skipped<\/a>. &nbsp;If it has jumped too much the Ameo may not even fire.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. &nbsp;Vacuum Leak<\/h3>\n<p>Your Ameo&#8217;s engine creates a vacuum as it runs. &nbsp;The amount that is created is carefully thought out during the engine design process. &nbsp;When there is too much vacuum, it creates a situation where air is not coming in and being read by the MAF sensor, which causes the vehicle to run wrong and not accelerate. &nbsp;The MAF sensor also may not be functioning correctly. &nbsp;If this is the case, it&#8217;ll almost always throw a trouble code.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Volkswagen-Ameo-bad-mass-airflow-sensor\/\">Volkswagen Ameo: Bad MAF Sensor \u2192 Symptoms and Causes<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion:
