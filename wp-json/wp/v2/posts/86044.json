Wheel speed sensors monitor the rotational speed of each wheel and send it back to the ABS module. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If one of the wheels is moving slower than the others, the ABS module recognizes that it is about to lock up. &nbsp;It reduces brake pressure on that particular wheel to keep it from doing so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the wheel speed sensor no longer sends a signal to your Stream&#8217;s ABS system (or the voltage value is out of range), the ABS light will be activated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Stream&#8217;s stability assist shouldn\u2019t be working if there\u2019s a wheel speed sensor problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. &nbsp;ABS Module or Pump<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-base-2-background-color has-background\"><strong>The only sign of an ABS module problem should be a trouble code<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/ABS-Light-On-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/ABS-Light-On-Diagnosis.png\" alt=\"Honda Stream ABS Light On Diagnosis\" class=\"wp-image-84983\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/ABS-Light-On-Diagnosis.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/ABS-Light-On-Diagnosis-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The ABS module controls the antilock brake system. If it becomes damaged and can no longer control all four brakes, the ABS light will activate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ABS pump can reduce the brake pressure at each wheel, which keeps them from locking up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, corrosion is the most common reason why the ABS module fails. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. &nbsp;Low Brake Fluid<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/brake-fluid-reservoir.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/brake-fluid-reservoir.jpg\" alt=\"Diagnosing ABS Light\" class=\"wp-image-177857\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/brake-fluid-reservoir.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/brake-fluid-reservoir-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-base-2-background-color has-background\"><strong>The brake warning light should also be on.&nbsp; There may be a squishy pedal.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start here if your brake warning light is on. It&#8217;s not as simple as pouring more fluid in. You&#8217;ll need to determine how the fluid got out and repair the leak. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the fluid reservoir level is too low to keep pressure in the ABS lines, the ABS light will come on.&nbsp; Without the proper pressure, the ABS system will no longer be able to activate physically.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Low Tire Pressure<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Tires.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Tires.jpg\" alt=\"ABS Light on Fix Stream\" class=\"wp-image-277875\" width=\"412\" height=\"274\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Tires.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Tires-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Tires-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-base-2-background-color has-background\"><strong>Appears with the low tire pressure light.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extremely low tire pressure can cause your Stream&#8217;s ABS light to come on. When the tire pressure gets low, it effectively reduces the diameter of the wheel and tire combination. Inflating the tires can get you back on the road.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. ABS Fuse<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Test-Washer-Fuse-scaled.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"550\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Test-Washer-Fuse-1024x550.jpg\" alt=\"ABS Not Working Fuse Test\" class=\"wp-image-288854\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Test-Washer-Fuse-1024x550.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Test-Washer-Fuse-300x161.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Test-Washer-Fuse-768x413.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Test-Washer-Fuse-1536x825.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Test-Washer-Fuse-2048x1100.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">You can test the ABS fuse without pulling it. With your car running, touch a test light on both of the fuse contacts. If your Stream has a blown ABS fuse, the test light will only turn on when touching one of the prongs. This is more reliable than examining the fuse.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If the fuse\/relay to the ABS module has blown, the ABS light will activate. To find its location, you&#8217;ll need to reference the owner&#8217;s manual for your Stream&#8217;s model year and engine combination.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>ABS Light on Fix<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the ABS light is on, the&nbsp;PCM will have a related code stored in its memory.&nbsp; That\u2019s the starting point for diagnosing an ABS light in the Honda Stream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Scan Your Stream for Brake System Codes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"ABS Light Fix\" class=\"wp-image-190153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Brake system trouble codes will tell you what part of the brake system needs to be addressed.

The ABS light is different than the brake warning light itself. &nbsp;The brake warning light indicates a problem with the physical braking system and that your Stream is unsafe to drive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you can drive your Stream with the ABS light on. But is it safe? Unfortunately, it&#8217;s<strong> not as safe, especially when it&#8217;s raining, snowing, or the road surface is loose\/uneven<\/strong>. &nbsp;That&#8217;s why we recommend having the ABS system fixed as soon as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wheels that are turning will slow your Honda Stream faster than a wheel that locks up. &nbsp;Skidding tires will get a flat spot quickly, which can be inconvenient and dangerous. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ABS also allows you to steer your car while slowing down and has been around for so long that many drivers have never driven a vehicle without it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not advisable to ignore your Honda Stream&#8217;s ABS light. &nbsp;Most of the time, the wheel speed sensors are going to be what triggers it. &nbsp;If there is anything you would like to add, please leave a comment below. &nbsp;Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your Honda Stream&#8217;s ABS Light comes on when it fails a self-diagnostic cycle. &nbsp;When on, it indicates that your car does not have Anti-Lock brakes and the safety they provide.
