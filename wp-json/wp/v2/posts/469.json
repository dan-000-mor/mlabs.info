That clicking sound is more than likely the starter solenoid.\u00a0 You probably have a bad starter motor.\u00a0 It is a much more common issue than a <strong>bad neutral safety switch<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Turn your headlights on. Get a friend to stand in front of the vehicle or find something reflective to let you see your lights (or turn of the light and close the garage door if you are lucky enough to be in a garage with this problem).\u00a0 Now turn the key. \u00a0<strong>If the lights stay on and bright than it could be the neutral safety switch<\/strong>.\u00a0 You were checking to make sure that you didn\u2019t have a bad battery or battery connection.\u00a0 If your lights did dim really bad you may wish to check and see if the battery is corroded.\u00a0 Follow this YouTube tutorial to fix a corroded battery issue.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/5vWu4qIGLEw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security system. <strong>Many vehicles have a security system that will activate the neutral safety switch<\/strong> in order to keep the vehicle from starting.\u00a0 The security light will usually go out with all of the other lights on the dash.\u00a0 If it stays on, than that may be the issue that is keeping the vehicle from starting<\/li>\n<li>Many vehicles also have a switch that only lets you start the vehicle with the brake pedal pushed in. This is not as common as a neutral safety switch, but worth looking into.<\/li>\n<li>It could be a locked engine. That will keep it from turning over.\u00a0 Unless you have some reason to believe that you\u2019ve run the motor out of oil, this is way less likely than the neutral safety switch going bad.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"2\">How the Neutral safety switch works in a manual transmission<\/h2>\n<p>The neutral safety switch in a vehicle with a manual transmission is going to look a heck of a lot like a brake light switch.\u00a0 It works in the same fashion as the brake light switch.\u00a0 It will allow the vehicle to start in any gear, but it\u2019ll only fire if the clutch is pressed in all of the way (even in neutral).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>How the Neutral safety switch works in an automatic transmission<\/h2>\n<p>On more modern vehicles, it is often located where the shift linkage attaches to the transmission on modern vehicles.\u00a0 It could also be somewhere on the column.\u00a0 You\u2019ll need to consult your repair guide or the internet (you\u2019re already there anyway!) to find the exact location of your neutral safety switch.\u00a0 The neutral safety switch allows the car or truck to start in both park and neutral.\u00a0 Both of these \u201cgears\u201d are not really gears.\u00a0 They provide neither forward or rearward momentum.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Help if You are Stranded with a Bad Neutral Safety Switch\">I\u2019m Stuck with a bad neutral safety switch NOW!<\/h2>\n<p>Are you stuck somewhere and your pretty sure that you have a bad neutral safety switch?\u00a0\u00a0 Try this to get you out of jam so you can get home or somewhere safe to make the repair.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Older Fords are notorious for needing a little help to engage the safety switch. Try lifting the column shifter higher like there is a gear above park.\u00a0 At the same time you do this keep the key turned in the forward position to engage the starter if it works.\u00a0 This works on a lot of vehicles.\u00a0 Try this on any make of vehicle<\/li>\n<li>Keep the key toward start and rock the steering wheel back and forth. Sometimes the mechanism that keeps the vehicle in park won\u2019t engage all the way.\u00a0 This is why you should ALWAYS use your parking brake.\u00a0 When you rock the wheel you\u2019ll be settling the transmission and it may start<\/li>\n<li>Put the vehicle in Neutral. It may not work in Park, but it may work in Neutral! \u00a0Simple right? \u00a0This works a surprisingly high amount of time.<\/li>\n<li>Keep your foot firmly on the brake. Turn the key to engage the starter and shift through all of the gears.\u00a0 You may very well end up engaging the Neutral Safety Switch in a gear it\u2019s not supposed to work in.\u00a0 If this works you\u2019ll be starting the car in gear so don\u2019t just take the foot off of the brake until you are in the gear that you need to put the transmission in.<\/li>\n<li>If you have a manual transmission keep the key turned, your foot on the brake, and the key turned forward. \u00a0You&#8217;ll want to keep pushing the clutch pushed down. \u00a0It may engage the neutral safety switch.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"What is a neutral safety switch\">What is a neutral safety switch?<\/h2>\n<p>Simply put, <strong>a neutral safety switch is a device that keeps your car from starting when it is in gear<\/strong>.\u00a0 Otherwise, if you were to bump your starter, the vehicle would move forward.\u00a0 Back in the olden days before neutral safety switches were common, it wasn&#8217;t unusual to see a vehicle &#8220;run away&#8221; when somebody bumped the starter.\u00a0 Clearly this presented a very real danger to people and property that was in the path of the car or truck.\u00a0 That&#8217;s where the neutral safety switch came in.\u00a0 It eliminated these problems:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is much more difficult (but not impossible) for the vehicle to start when it is in gear, a neutral safety switch keeps a vehicle from lurching forward into things.<\/li>\n<li>Starting in gear is bad for the starter as well as the engine mounts.\u00a0 The vehicle will &#8220;buck&#8221; like a horse when the starter and transmission are engaged at the same time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Where is the Neutral Safety Switch located\">Where is the neutral safety switch?<\/h2>\n<p>Where the neutral safety switch is on your vehicle is going to depend a lot upon who made the car, how old it is, and whether or not it was equipped with a manual transmission or not.<\/p>\n<h4>Automatic Transmissions<\/h4>\n<p>On most modern automatic transmission, the neutral safety switch is attached where the transmission and shift linkage connect to one another.\u00a0 It&#8217;ll look like a little black box that goes right around where the shifter connects.\u00a0 Manufacturers put it there so that regardless of what gear the shifter says\u00a0 it&#8217;s in, the gear that the transmission is currently in will determine if the car starts.\u00a0 This can save you from the car starting in gear when you have a broken shift linkage.<\/p>\n<p>On older vehicles, the neutral safety switch is wired into the column and will only let the car start when it&#8217;s in the neutral position or not.\u00a0 A lot of people who put in floor shifters have had problems thinking they had a bad starter or ignition when really the column shifter nub has moved a little bit.<\/p>\n<h4>Manual Transmissions<\/h4>\n<p>The neutral safety switch on a manual transmission is going to be easy to find.\u00a0 It&#8217;s a plunger type switch that lets the vehicle start when you press the clutch in.\u00a0 The neutral safety switch on a manual transmission is always going to be located where the clutch pedal meets the floor.\u00a0 Just look at the pedal.\u00a0 It&#8217;ll be there.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not very likely that you\u2019ll have any sort of issue with a neutral safety switch over the life of a modern car, but if you do I hope this helps.\u00a0 Thanks for reading!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Back in the day, when you\u2019d go to start a car it would be entirely possible for you to bump the starter and have the vehicle just take off.\u00a0 This would cause damage to property, other vehicles, and even human life.\u00a0 The Neutral Safety Switch was invented to curtail this issue.\u00a0 The neutral safety switch &#8230;
