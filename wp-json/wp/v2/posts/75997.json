decrease, leaving it with a diminished capacity for starting the vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>When this happens, you&#8217;ll often hear the vehicle crank slowly, but not start.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You can take your battery up to the local parts store, or even Wal-Mart, and have it tested to see if it is still holding a charge.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Battery is Dead<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;If it&#8217;s dead, but charges back up and tests &#8220;good&#8221;, it would be time to check the battery terminals or have the alternator tested and see if it is properly charging the battery.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Battery is Charged<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;If the battery is charged, then it would still be advisable to take a look at the battery cables and see if there is an issue with corrosion. &nbsp;Otherwise, it may be the starter that you need to look at.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-alternator-symptoms-Ford-Flex\/\">bad alternator<\/a> can cause your battery to lose enough charge to start your Flex. &nbsp;It may have had enough energy to get you home, but when you go to start the vehicle, there&#8217;s not enough stored energy for the engine to turn over.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. &nbsp;Starter<\/h3>\n<p>The next thing to look at when your Flex isn&#8217;t starting would be the starter itself. &nbsp;When the starter isn&#8217;t functioning, it is impossible to start the vehicle (unless it&#8217;s a manual, then you can pop start it). &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve determined that a fully charged battery without corroded cable is the culprit, then it&#8217;s time to question whether or not you need a new starter. &nbsp;When a starter goes bad, they will usually not give you much warning first. &nbsp;Also, if you are stuck somewhere and are trying to start your Flex, the old beat the starter with a hammer trick is not a wives tale. &nbsp;It really can get that one last start out of it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Engine Cranking - Not Starting\">Ford Flex: &nbsp;Engine Cranks \u2192 Won&#8217;t Start<\/h2>\n<p>There are a lot of issues that can cause your Flex to crank, but not start. &nbsp;The engine needs air, fuel, and a spark in order to run.<\/p>\n<p>It is highly likely that if the engine is cranking, but not starting that it has thrown an OBDII code. &nbsp;It is definitely worth it to use an <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2MJVQ0Q\">OBDII scanner<\/a> to check and see if the engine has thrown any trouble codes. &nbsp;It is highly likely that if your Flex won&#8217;t start that there will be codes. &nbsp;These codes will tell you what the computer is saying is wrong with your engine.<\/p>\n<p>By looking them up on this site, or just Googling them in general will lead you to a detailed diagnosis of that code. &nbsp;Hopefully, once the code has been addressed your Flex&#8217;s engine will start again.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75806\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75806\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Wont-Start-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75806\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Wont-Start-Diagnosis.png\" alt=\"Ford Flex Won't Start Diagnosis\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Wont-Start-Diagnosis.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Wont-Start-Diagnosis-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-75806\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">If your Flex won&#8217;t start, be happy if you see the check engine light. The OBDII codes stored in the computer can really help diagnose the issue.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>1. &nbsp;Fuel Issues<\/h3>\n<p>If your Flex isn&#8217;t getting enough fuel, or any fuel at all, it may have a <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Ford-Flex-bad-fuel-filter\/\">bad fuel filter<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Ford-Flex-bad-fuel-pump-symptoms\/\">bad fuel pump<\/a>, or bad fuel injectors. &nbsp;Without the proper amount of fuel getting into the combustion chamber, the Flex will crank, but not start.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. &nbsp;Ignition Issues<\/h3>\n<p>One of the biggest issues that causes a vehicle to crank but not start is ignition issues. &nbsp;When there is no spark, the engine will not start. &nbsp;You&#8217;ll probably have a misfire related code such as <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0300-Ford-Flex\/\">P0300<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0301-Ford-Flex\/\">P0301<\/a>, etc&#8230;..<\/p>\n<p>Ignition issues can be caused by many things, including <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-spark-plug-symptoms-Ford-Flex\/\">bad spark plugs<\/a>, bad coil packs, bad plug wires, computer issues, and more.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. &nbsp;Engine Timing<\/h3>\n<p>If the engine&#8217;s ability to fire the spark plug at the right time is called &#8220;timing&#8221;. &nbsp;If the plugs are firing at the wrong time, or something has happened to cause the camshaft to no longer be in sync with the crankshaft, your Flex won&#8217;t start.<\/p>\n<p>There will usually be OBDII codes associated with timing related problems, but not always. &nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0013-Ford-Flex\/\">P0013<\/a>&nbsp;is a common camshaft position related code. &nbsp;The crankshaft sensor can go bad as well. &nbsp;When these sensors go bad, it can be impossible for your Flex to start.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. Security<\/h3>\n<p>Most modern vehicles come with smart keys that have electronic protection built in. &nbsp;This makes it more challenging for thieves to steal them. &nbsp;There are occasions where this security system will cause the Flex to not start. &nbsp;You&#8217;ll see a security warning when trying to crank the engine though.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>5. &nbsp;Other Issues<\/h3>\n<p>There are a lot of issues that can cause your Flex to not start. &nbsp;That&#8217;s why it is so important to check everything. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ifitjams.com\/starting.htm#starting7\">great diagnostic chart<\/a> that covers many different variables. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Ford Flex Not Starting<\/h2>\n<p>There are many reasons that your Flex may not start. &nbsp;Tracking them down can be downright challenging. &nbsp;With enough time and patience, you can diagnose exactly what is wrong. &nbsp;Good luck with the diagnosis. &nbsp;If there is anything that you would like to add, please leave a comment below. &nbsp;Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It can be very frustrating when a vehicle won&#8217;t start. &nbsp;There are many different issues that can cause the problem. &nbsp;This article is written with the assumption that you are looking for a way to get your Ford Flex started now, and is meant to provide you with practical advice to help aid &#8230; <a title=\"Ford Flex Won&#8217;t Start Diagnosis\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/ford-flex-wont-start\/\" aria-label=\"More on Ford Flex Won&#8217;t Start Diagnosis\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[209],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/75997"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=75997"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/75997\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=75997"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=75997"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=75997"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
