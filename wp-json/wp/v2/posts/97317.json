&nbsp;That&#8217;s a tell tale sign that the fuel is going somewhere, but not the engine.<\/p>\n<p>Here are places that fuel will commonly leak from:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>1. &nbsp;Fuel Lines<\/h3>\n<p>If one of the fuel lines has been damaged, you should be able to find the leak by doing an inspection. &nbsp;Is there gas on the garage floor? &nbsp;That is a tell-tale sign of a fuel leak. &nbsp;If you do find gas, you should consider your car undrivable until you have it repaired. &nbsp;It could catch fire.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. &nbsp;Gas Tank<\/h3>\n<p>A typical place where gas leaks form is the fuel filler neck. &nbsp;Specifically, where the neck meets the tank. &nbsp;There is a seal there that can go bad over time. &nbsp;Replacing it will solve the gas smell.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. &nbsp;Injectors<\/h3>\n<p>If a fuel injector is leaking, it will allow too much fuel to dump into the engine.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>There are a lot of things that can cause you car to smell like gas. &nbsp;Even though it&#8217;s very likely that it&#8217;s a benign reason, always give the smell of gas the respect it deserves until you find the leak.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If your car smells like gas, it should be treated like you have a fuel leak until you know there isn&#8217;t one. &nbsp;The smell of gas is typically going to be caused by a bad gas cap, evaporative emissions system, overfilling the gas tank, or an actual fuel leak. &nbsp; Vehicle Smells Like Gas (No &#8230; <a title=\"Car Smells Like Gas:  Diagnosis\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/car-smells-like-gas\/\" aria-label=\"More on Car Smells Like Gas:  Diagnosis\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[34],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/97317"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=97317"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/97317\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=97317"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=97317"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=97317"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
