This trouble code references a number that is given to you when you plug your Avalanche into a OBDII scanner. P0455 Indicates that there is a <strong>large leak<\/strong> in the evaporative emission control system. It often appears with, or is related other codes, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0420-chevy-Avalanche\/\">P0420<\/a>, P0441, and espescially P0440.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"qna-section__heading qna-section__heading--normal\"><strong>P0455: <\/strong>System Gross Leak Evaporative Emission<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>P0455 is normally not an immediate threat to the drive-ability of your Avalanche. Certainly anytime the service engine soon light is on, it&#8217;s good to deal with it as soon as possible though. It is often accompanied by P0442. See <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0442-Chevy-Avalanche\/\">Chevy Avalanche P0442 OBDII Code<\/a> for more.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Chevy Avalanche P0455 Definition<\/h2>\n<p>P0455 is a universal OBDII trouble code. This means that regardless of which make or model of vehicle, the code will mean the same thing (Avalanche or not). The code technically stands for:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">System Gross Leak Evaporative Emission System<\/p>\n<p>The EVAP system captures all fuel vapor from the fuel tank and sends them to the engines intake in order to be ignited in the normal combustion process. When there is a large leak in the Chevy Avalanche&#8217;s EVAP system, it will throw the P0455 OBDII Code.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Chevy Avalanche P0455 OBDII Code Symptoms<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2825\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2825\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Service-Engine-Soon.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2825 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Service-Engine-Soon-300x240.png\" alt=\"P0455 OBDII Code Diagnosis Chevy Avalanche\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Service-Engine-Soon-300x240.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Service-Engine-Soon-768x614.png 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Service-Engine-Soon-1024x819.png 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Service-Engine-Soon-100x80.png 100w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Service-Engine-Soon-150x120.png 150w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Service-Engine-Soon-200x160.png 200w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Service-Engine-Soon-450x360.png 450w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Service-Engine-Soon-600x480.png 600w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Service-Engine-Soon-900x720.png 900w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Service-Engine-Soon.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2825\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The service engine soon light is often the only sign that the P0455 code has been triggered<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>P0455 code will typically not be accompanied by any noticeable symptoms other than the <strong>smell of gas<\/strong> and the <strong>service engine soon<\/strong> light. You may notice the slightest dip in fuel economy as well.<\/p>\n<p>You should particularly notice the smell of fuel around the fuel tank area or fuel filler tube.<\/p>\n<p>The EVAP system deals directly with fuel vapors. If these vapors are leaking from the system, you&#8217;ll often smell them faintly while operating the vehicle.<\/p>\n<h2>Avalanche P0455 Trouble Code Causes<\/h2>\n<p>There are many things that can cause the P0455 trouble code to trigger in your Chevy Avalanche. Here are the most common problems that will throw the code:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Evap System Hose<\/strong>&#8211; The hose that carries the fuel vapor from the fuel tank to the intake manifold can begin to leak. This will cause the P0455 code. Look for either a tear or hole in it. This is one of the most common issues that causes the code<\/li>\n<li><strong>Vapor Canister Purge Valve<\/strong>&#8211; One of the most common causes of the P0455 code is the vapor canister purge valve. It&#8217;s really easy to replace. There are a few clips that you need to find and remove.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Faulty Charcoal Canister<\/strong>&#8211; The charcoal canister is often the cause of P0455.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fuel Tank Sending Unit<\/strong>&#8211; It is possible for the gasket that attaches the fuel sending unit to the gas tank to go bad. This can reduce tank pressure and throw the code.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fuel Cap<\/strong>&#8211; A bad fuel cap can cause the code to be thrown for sure. Often, you&#8217;ll get a message informing you that the fuel cap is off even when it is on. If you are getting that message, plus a P0455, it may save you a ton of time and money to replace the fuel cap and see if it goes away.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fuel Filler Neck<\/strong>&#8211; There is often a gasket where the fuel filler neck connects with the gas tank. This gasket can dry out, especially with vehicles that spend their time in dry climates. When it dries out, the fuel tank can&#8217;t hold pressure anymore.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>P0455 Diagnosis- Chevy Avalanche<\/h2>\n<p>A mechanic has a wide range of instruments at his disposal to diagnose what would be causing the P0455 in your Chevy Avalanche. Here are the most common things that are done to diagnose the code:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The mechanic will typically check to see if there are any other trouble codes. The more trouble codes there are, the easier it can be to diagnose a problem. That&#8217;s because when they appear together in certain combinations, there will often only be only a few conditions that will throw any combination of codes at one time.<\/li>\n<li>After ascertaining what trouble codes appear with the P0455, the mechanic will typically <b>inspect the EVAP system<\/b>. This includes the purge valve, line, and canister.<\/li>\n<li>The mechanic will inspect the gas cap to make sure that it can handle pressure. If you are getting a warning that your gas cap is off, even when it&#8217;s on, replacing it will more than likely clear this code.<\/li>\n<li>The fuel tank pressure will be checked and monitored.<\/li>\n<li>After for the checks and fixes listed above, the mechanic will perform two tests:<\/li>\n<li>A smoke test, and they&#8217;ll use a scan tool to confirm that the EVAP solenoids and valves are operating properly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a pretty good video on diagnosing these leaks from Scotty Kilmer, if you are interested:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Ru8A7aYCUM8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>While the trouble code may state that there is a &#8220;large leak&#8221; in the EVAP system of your Chevy Avalanche, the actual leak will most likely still look rather small. The &#8220;large&#8221; really is referring to how much pressure is being lost.<\/p>\n<h2>Most Common P0455 Fixes<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0455-Code-Fix.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-3036\" src=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0455-Code-Fix-300x239.png\" alt=\"P0455 Fix Chevy Avalanche\" width=\"200\" height=\"159\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0455-Code-Fix-300x239.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0455-Code-Fix-768x611.png 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0455-Code-Fix-100x80.png 100w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0455-Code-Fix-150x119.png 150w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0455-Code-Fix-200x159.png 200w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0455-Code-Fix-450x358.png 450w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0455-Code-Fix-600x477.png 600w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0455-Code-Fix-900x716.png 900w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0455-Code-Fix.png 905w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here are the most common Avalanche P0455 fixes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gas cap replacement<\/li>\n<li>EVAP line replacement<\/li>\n<li>Replace charcoal canister<\/li>\n<li>Replace the fuel tank<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of all the items listed above, it would be wise to start with the gas cap and work your way to the fuel tank, since the gas cap is far and away the easiest and least expensive items to replace on here.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a great video on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QcK9ejiHBSU\">how to test your gas cap<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Good luck figuring out what is causing your Chevy Avalanche to throw the P0455 code.
