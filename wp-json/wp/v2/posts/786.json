\u00a0If they all come from the same pull than there is no question of whether or not they&#8217;ll work together.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Transmission<\/h3>\n<p>The LS engines will bolt with any of the non computer\u00a0controlled &#8220;old school&#8221; transmissions. \u00a0They certainly work best with the transmissions that they were designed to run, but they&#8217;ll do just fine with say a <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/turbo-hydramatic-350\/th350-transmission-identification\/\">TH350<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/th400\/\">TH400<\/a>. \u00a0There are a few things to consider when deciding what to do about the transmission.<\/p>\n<p>We have a whole post on that <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/ls-engine-swap-transmission-guide\/\">LS Swap Transmissions<\/a> if you would like to learn more about it.<\/p>\n<h3>Crossmember and Motor Mounts<\/h3>\n<p>This is an incredibly crucial aspect to the swap. \u00a0You can buy some inexpensive universal LS swap motor mounts on eBay or Amazon. \u00a0They may or may not work with your engine bay. \u00a0One thing that people often overlook when it comes to the swap is pinion angle. \u00a0If the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.speedwaymotors.com\/the-toolbox\/setting-proper-driveshaft-angles\/28855\">pinion angle<\/a> is off because the motor mounts are different (even if you leave the factory crossmember) the driveline is going to vibrate the car at speed, which makes the quality of ride not nearly as pleasing.<\/p>\n<h3>Fuel System<\/h3>\n<p>Most people who do this swap are swapping it into a vehicle that\u00a0came from the factory with a carburetor. \u00a0LS engines want around 100 pounds of fuel pressure to properly atomize the fuel and deliver it to the cylinder. \u00a0The factory fuel lines are just not going to be able to handle that kind of pressure. \u00a0 An electric fuel pump is a necessity, even if you are using a carb. \u00a0 There&#8217;s inline and in tank fuel options from vendors such as Tanks Inc. \u00a0This is an area that can really blow out the budget. \u00a0You can spend about $100 to get the basic setup, or full blown EFI tank with pump and lines is going to be $700.<\/p>\n<h3>Headers and Exhaust Manifolds<\/h3>\n<p>The stock <strong>exhaust manifolds<\/strong> that came with the engine itself are usually fine for most applications. \u00a0You&#8217;ll find that the LS1 (and car motors in general) manifolds stay closer to the block than the truck engine&#8217;s manifolds, which makes them fit in more applications. \u00a0If you are swapping in a truck engine than it may be necessary to use a Camaro\/Vette manifold on the steering box side. \u00a0<strong>Headers<\/strong> can be tricky. \u00a0They really should be considered with the motor mounts.<\/p>\n<h3>Wiring<\/h3>\n<p>There are two aspects to the wiring that must be addressed. \u00a0The first one is the <strong>wiring harness itself<\/strong>. \u00a0There are plenty of youtube videos and online tutorials that&#8217;ll help get the wiring harness straightened out. \u00a0The best source for this is lt1swap.com. \u00a0Here is a link to the best page to start.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lt1swap.com\/wiringharness.htm\">http:\/\/lt1swap.com\/wiringharness.htm<\/a><\/p>\n<p>If the prospect of removing all of those pins and wiring seems a little to much (I always farm this part out), I recommend sending off for a rework. \u00a0There are plenty of people on eBay who provide this service for $100 or so. Here is a video that shows what is involved. This guy has some great videos for a swapper to watch.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tITS_uOXZrU?ecver=1\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The second thing is the <strong>ECM<\/strong>. \u00a0It has to be reprogrammed. \u00a0There are security measures associated with it where it can&#8217;t just be plugged in and run. \u00a0The anti-theft system must be deleted.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike the wiring, which you can do yourself, the ECM is going to need to be shipped out to be reprogrammed. \u00a0Odds are you can find someone in your area who will do it for you on the cheap. \u00a0Otherwise you can check eBay. \u00a0People are always auctioning off rewiring\/reprogramming services on there. \u00a0The going rate is around $60. \u00a0This will get the ECM ready to run a stock motor with no modifications. \u00a0The tuners can remove the active torque management as well, if it&#8217;s a drive by wire setup.<\/p>\n<p>If the engine in question is getting a camshaft that &#8220;requires tuning&#8221; than you&#8217;re going to have to send off for a special programing to make it run properly with it. \u00a0 \u00a0Alternatively if you live in a major metropolitan area there should be a local speed shop to handle it for you. \u00a0As far as the mail in tunes go, black bear is the best there is. \u00a0Check them out<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.blackbearperformance.com\">blackbearperformance.com<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Cooling System<\/h3>\n<p>The LS engine runs pretty cool, so most factory radiators can handle the heat generated by it. \u00a0Now, there is one thing that must be addressed. \u00a0The steam vent tube. \u00a0Some people block it off or don&#8217;t know what to do with it. \u00a0It needs to be run to the radiator, or back to a radiator hose. \u00a0Those are your two options.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you are considering swapping out your motor for an LS motor, there is a lot to consider. \u00a0It is totally doable, and absolutely worth it. \u00a0The performance and drive-ability improvements that these engines add to an older model vehicle are amazing.
