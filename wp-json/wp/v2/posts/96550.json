Wheel Out of Alignment<\/h3>\n<p>Wheel alignment is the number one reason why your Camry would start to <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/car-pulls-to-the-left\/\">pull to the left<\/a>.&nbsp; All it takes is the right pothole or unexpected bump to throw the alignment off, which causes your tires to no longer make consistent contact with the road, which in turn causes it to pull to the left.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of geometry involved in adjusting the suspension back into place.&nbsp; An alignment shop is going to be your best bet.&nbsp; An alignment is very affordable compared to the cost of a new set of tires.<\/p>\n<p>Putting off an alignment after you start to notice your Camry pulling to the left will eventually cause your tires to start wearing unevenly.&nbsp; When this happens, you may need to replace the tires and get an alignment.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Vehicle-Pulls-to-the-Left.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-96547\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Vehicle-Pulls-to-the-Left.png\" alt=\"Toyota Camry Pulls to the Left Diagnosis\" width=\"400\" height=\"248\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>3.&nbsp; Brakes<\/h3>\n<p>If the brake system has begun to stick, it can force your Camry to pull left even when you aren&#8217;t braking.&nbsp; The number one reason that brakes stick is going to be a stuck caliper.<\/p>\n<p>When your brakes are sticking, they will often give off a smell.&nbsp; Stuck brakes don&#8217;t fully stop making contact with the rotors.&nbsp; This causes a lot of heat, which in turn causes them to &#8220;cook&#8221; for lack of a better term.&nbsp; This smell is often the same as the rotten egg smell of a clutch that is burning up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Investigate each wheel after driving and see if one of the brakes are stuck and causing the Camry to pull to the left.&nbsp; Remember, the nose knows.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a whole writeup on <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Camry-brakes-sticking\/\">Camry Brakes Sticking<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4.&nbsp; Suspension Issues<\/h3>\n<p>The suspension components that connect your steering wheel to your tires will go bad over time.&nbsp; All it takes is one of them going bad and your Toyota Camry will begin to pull to the left.<\/p>\n<p>Suspension items that can cause a vehicle to pull to the left include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ball Joints<\/li>\n<li>Rack and Pinion<\/li>\n<li>Tie Rods<\/li>\n<li>Steering Linkage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If your <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/shaking-steering-wheel-Toyota-Camry\/\">steering wheel is shaking<\/a> real bad, this could be a clue you are on the right track.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>5.&nbsp; Wheel Bearings<\/h3>\n<p>If one of the wheel bearings on the left side of the Camry has gone bad, it will begin to act as a brake that pulls the vehicle in one direction.&nbsp; When this happens, you need to have the wheel bearing replaced immediately.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It should be accompanied by a grating hum sound that gets louder as the Camry&#8217;s speed increases.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s more on <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Camry-wheel-bearing-noise\/\">diagnosing a bad wheel bearing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion:&nbsp; Toyota Camry Pulls Left<\/h2>\n<p>As you can see above, there are a lot of problems that can cause a Toyota Camry to pull to the left.&nbsp; It is most often an alignment issue that causes this problem.&nbsp; You should check the tire pressure before doing anything else.&nbsp; Good luck!
