However, there are a few less common reasons as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t hear any noise coming from the blower motor, the air conditioner not working check these two items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bad Blower Motor (Most Likely)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blower motors are known to fail without warning. If all the dash lights are on, the climate control system looks like it should be working, and no air moves, you should suspect the blower motor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before replacing it, turn the fan up to its highest setting. If air starts blowing at full blast, suspect the blower motor resistor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to <a href=\"https:\/\/electrouniversity.com\/how-to-test-blower-motor-with-multimeter\/\">test a blower motor with a multimeter<\/a> (electrouniversity)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blower Motor Resistor<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Blower-Motor-Resistor.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Blower-Motor-Resistor-711x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Chevy Orlando Blower Motor Causing No Air Conditioning\" class=\"wp-image-275880\" width=\"156\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Blower-Motor-Resistor-711x1024.jpg 711w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Blower-Motor-Resistor-208x300.jpg 208w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Blower-Motor-Resistor-768x1106.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Blower-Motor-Resistor.jpg 972w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 156px) 100vw, 156px\" \/><\/a><figcaption>Blower motor resistors come in many shapes and sizes<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on how your particular model year of Orlando&#8217;s blower motor resistor question, it will still be able to turn on the blower motor when you turn the speed all the way up.

AC System Not Blowing Cold Enough<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common reason for your Chevy Orlando&#8217;s AC not blowing cold enough is low refrigerant levels, followed by a dirty evaporator or condenser issues (bad or clogged).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Refrigerant Leak<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover is-light\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim\"><\/span><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"585\" class=\"wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-275882\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Testing-AC-Car.jpg\" data-object-fit=\"cover\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Testing-AC-Car.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Testing-AC-Car-300x176.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Testing-AC-Car-768x449.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\"><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Testing your Orlando&#8217;s AC system pressure can help determine if you are chasing a leak or if there\u2019s another issue at work.&nbsp; If the A\/C system leaks, you can chase it down with a leak detection kit and UV dye.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Here\u2019s how to go about testing the pressure and chasing the leak:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How to Find AC Leaks in Your Car (UV Dye)\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/pCv7rCdcXsc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you add too much coolant to your van, you can cause more leaks in the AC system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the refrigerant leaks out of the system, eventually, there won\u2019t be enough left to cool your Orlando.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having the system recharged can temporarily get your AC system blowing cold again.&nbsp; But, the coolant will leak out again. As a result, the system pressure will diminish, and you\u2019ll have to repeat the cycle until you discover WHY the system was leaking and repair it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blend Door Stuck<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Very few vehicles still use manually controlled blend doors (where there is a wire that connects to the temperature slider). They almost all use blend door actuators. Your Orlando&#8217;s blend door is responsible for adjusting how much air gets in from the A\/C system and the heater core.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blend door actuator may be bad or stuck if your AC system is not blowing cold air.&nbsp; Sometimes, when on an all-day trip, the blend door can freeze up, and it\u2019ll stay in whatever position it was in when frozen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When your Orlando&#8217;s A\/C is blowing WARMER than the outside temperature, it strongly indicates that the blend door actuator is causing the cooling issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what a bad blend door actuator sounds like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio\"><audio controls src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Bad-Blend-Door-Actuator.mp3\"><\/audio><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, it may come off as a fast and lighter clicking sound.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cooling Fan<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Cooling-Fans.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"555\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Cooling-Fans-1024x555.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-275884\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Cooling-Fans-1024x555.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Cooling-Fans-300x163.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Cooling-Fans-768x416.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Cooling-Fans.jpg 1376w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A defective cooling fan will cause your Orlando&#8217;s AC to stop working well. The cooling fan blows fresh air over the condenser and helps it dissipate heat.&nbsp; When the air going over it slows down, it can\u2019t do its job as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Suspect the cooling fan if the AC system blows colder when driving on the highway (which allows more air over the condenser).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ve probably noticed when you turn the A\/C on that you\u2019ll hear clicking and a blowing noise coming from the front of your Chevy Orlando.&nbsp; If that noise has stopped and the A\/C isn\u2019t blowing as cold as it once was, suspect the cooling fan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cooling fans can stop working for a few reasons.&nbsp; A blown fuse, wiring harness issue going to it (prime location for rodent damage), or a bad motor are the most common reasons this happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cabin Air Filter<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Clean-VS-Dirty-Cabin-Air-Filter.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Clean-VS-Dirty-Cabin-Air-Filter-844x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Replacing the cabin air filter is a great way to get the Orlando's AC working again\" class=\"wp-image-275887\" width=\"250\" height=\"302\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Clean-VS-Dirty-Cabin-Air-Filter-844x1024.jpg 844w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Clean-VS-Dirty-Cabin-Air-Filter-768x932.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Clean-VS-Dirty-Cabin-Air-Filter.jpg 852w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><\/a><figcaption>New VS old <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Orlando&#8217;s cabin air can cause the air speed coming from the blower motor to slow down.&nbsp; It is one of the most overlooked maintenance items on a vehicle.&nbsp; Almost all modern cars and trucks have them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>As a rule, most cabin air filters are accessed underneath the glove compartment and are located near the blower motor. Where it actually is is going to depend on the model year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Changing it will restore airspeed, but it won\u2019t do anything for you if you have warm air coming in the cabin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Condenser<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Chevy Orlando is blowing coolish (but not cold) air, a condenser issue is often the cause.&nbsp; You can check it at home.&nbsp; It\u2019s a little radiator that has A\/C lines running to and from it.&nbsp; It\u2019ll be right by the main radiator in the grille.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at it.&nbsp; If some large debris is keeping air from flowing over it, the AC system can\u2019t properly cool the vehicle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it\u2019s muddy or dirty, hose it off.&nbsp; It can make a difference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dirty Evaporator<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Evaporator-Core.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Evaporator-Core-1024x664.jpg\" alt=\"Chevy Orlando AC Not Working Fix\" class=\"wp-image-275881\" width=\"430\" height=\"279\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Evaporator-Core-1024x664.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Evaporator-Core-300x194.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Evaporator-Core-768x498.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Evaporator-Core-1536x995.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Evaporator-Core-2048x1327.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If the evaporator is dirty, one of the most common tells is that the A\/C system smells when it\u2019s on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, you only need to worry about this if you\u2019ve had something get in the AC system and nest up there or your Orlando has seen a very high amount of dirt in the cabin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.
