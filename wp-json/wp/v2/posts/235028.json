The first part is the malfunctioning part on your Land Cruiser, the second part indicates what is wrong, and the third part tells you where the malfunctioning HO2S is located.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HO2S <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The heated oxygen sensor measures the exhaust after it exits the combustion chamber.  The PCM uses this data to maintain the proper 14.7:1 air\/fuel ratio. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Heater Control Circuit High<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The heated element within your Toyota Land Cruiser&#8217;s oxygen sensor heats the sensor faster than the exhaust can on its own.  This reduces emissions by letting the fuel trim enter closed loop operation more quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of P0038, your Land Cruiser&#8217;s PCM has detected that the heater control circuit resistance is outside the manufacturer&#8217;s specified range.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bank 1 Sensor 2<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/O2-Sensor.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/O2-Sensor.jpg\" alt=\"P0038\" class=\"wp-image-188616\" width=\"464\" height=\"231\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/O2-Sensor.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/O2-Sensor-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/O2-Sensor-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px\" \/><\/a><figcaption>Hopefully, your O2 sensor is this easy to get to.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bank 1 Sensor 2 is the location of the oxygen sensor.  Bank 1 is the side of your Land Cruiser&#8217;s engine with the first cylinder.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You only need to concern yourself with this if you have a V6 or V8 engine.  If you have a four-cylinder or inline-six, there is only one bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sensor 2 is the first oxygen sensor &#8220;downstream&#8221; of the catalytic converter.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>P0038 Symptoms:  Toyota Land Cruiser<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There usually aren&#8217;t any noticeable symptoms for P0038, whatsoever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>P0038 Toyota Land Cruiser: Diagnosis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"P0038 Diagnosis\" class=\"wp-image-190153\" width=\"689\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the most common causes of P0038 in the Toyota Land Cruiser, as well as a decent order to check them in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-check-the-wiring-on-bank-1-sensor-1\">1. Check the Wiring on Bank 1 Sensor 2<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CHECK THE WIRING HARNESS FOR DAMAGE since P0038 indicates a fault in the heated O2 sensor circuit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pay extra close attention to where the harness may have rubbed up against something or has been damaged by road debris.  Look for burnt, frail, or damaged wiring.  Wiring issues are a VERY COMMON cause for P0038.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at where your Land Cruiser&#8217;s oxygen sensor plugs into the wiring harness and see if there has been any damage to the pins or if the wiring harness is breaking at the pigtail. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the pins appear corroded, get some electrical contact cleaner and clean them up.  If they are damaged, you will need to repin or replace your wiring harness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2a-verify-the-o2-sensor-is-bad-swap-test\">2a. Verify the O2 Sensor is Bad- Swap Test<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Land Cruiser happens to be a V6 or V8 model, you can do the &#8220;swap test&#8221;, if there is a catalytic converter for each side of the exhaust.  If the exhaust feeds into one converter, this won&#8217;t work. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This test involves clearing the codes and seeing if the code &#8220;jumps&#8221; to bank 2.  It&#8217;s a great test because it&#8217;s foolproof and easy to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how the swap test is done:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Clear the DTC codes with your scanner.<\/li><li>Swap the Bank 2 Sensor 2 O2 sensor with the Bank 1 Sensor 2.  It\u2019ll be right after the catalytic converter<\/li><li>Run your Land Cruiser&#8217;s engine until the check engine light comes back on. <\/li><li>If the code changes to P0058 (The Bank 2 version of this code), that\u2019s proof enough you need to replace the oxygen sensor you swapped.<\/li><li>If the code remains P0038, you\u2019ll need to continue pursuing your diagnosis, knowing that both O2 sensors are working fine.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2b-check-the-fuses-and-voltage\">2b. Check the O2 Sensor Heater Resistance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the heater element resistance.  This will for sure verify whether the heated element is bad or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is voltage at the heater circuit, you&#8217;ll need to test the ground for resistance.  If you find infinite resistance, you&#8217;ll need to repair the ground circuit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This YouTube video can help you test it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How to Test Resistance of O2 Sensor Heater\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YzkBdPP8l2g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-bad-oxygen-sensor\">3.
