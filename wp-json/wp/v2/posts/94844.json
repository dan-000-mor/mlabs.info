It might not seem possible to determine the color of the liquid in question, but a paper towel allowed to soak up enough coolant definitely will begin to show pigment. &nbsp;Water is tasteless and odorless.<\/p>\n<p>If it is engine coolant, it&#8217;ll be coming from different places than water typically will, and will need to be addressed separately. &nbsp;There is a section further down the page with common radiator leak causes, if it&#8217;s coolant that you found has leaked from your A1.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Leaking Water Causes: &nbsp;Audi A1<\/h2>\n<p>Here are the most common reasons that water may leak from your vehicle (not coolant, that is covered below).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Air Conditioning System<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;Your A1&#8217;s A\/C system leaks water directly underneath the engine bay as a byproduct of its operation. &nbsp;If you there is a big puddle of water under the vehicle, it may be because it was left running in place for a while. &nbsp;Fifteen minutes on a hot day can be enough to get a trail to the rear wheels. &nbsp;This is completely normal and should not be cause for alarm.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Exhaust System<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;Your A1&#8217;s engine creates steam as part of the combustion process. &nbsp;It is way more noticeable in the winter time when white smoke billows out of your exhaust pipes. &nbsp;Water can also leak out of the exhaust as this happens. &nbsp;A little water is completely normal. &nbsp;A lot of water leaking out of the tail pipe is certainly a cause for concern.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Leaking-Water-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-94166\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Leaking-Water-Diagnosis.png\" alt=\"Audi A1 Leaking Water Diagnosis\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"><\/a><\/h3>\n<h3>Some Water Under Your A1 Might be OK<\/h3>\n<p>Your A1&#8217;s air conditioning system is going to produce water as a product of the cooling process. &nbsp;This is normal. &nbsp;It will usually produce moisture just behind the rear tires. &nbsp;This is harmless water, and is nothing to worry about.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Audi A1: &nbsp;Leaking Cooling System<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve found coolant on the garage floor, and not leaking water, that&#8217;ll be an entirely different set of circumstances causing the leak.<\/p>\n<p>It is possible that your coolant system could be leaking water. &nbsp;If you, or whoever had the vehicle before you filled the cooling system up with water instead of antifreeze coolant, it could be leaking water. &nbsp;The problem is that water will freeze in the winter time and cause the engine block, heads, freeze plugs, or some other part of the engine to freeze up.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Common Places Your Cooling System Leaks Water<\/h3>\n<p>If your A1&#8217;s cooling system is leaking water or coolant, here are the most common places that it may be leaking from.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Thermostat Housing<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;The thermostat is a small device that acts as a barrier that lets coolant into the engine only when it reaches a certain temperature (usually a bit over 200 degrees). &nbsp;There is a housing that bolts to the block that holds the thermostat. &nbsp;It&#8217;ll have a radiator hose attached to it. &nbsp;It is very common to find that your A1 is leaking water or (hopefully) coolant from this location. &nbsp;It&#8217;ll be toward the front of the vehicle, further up than where the A\/C condensation would be.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Radiator<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;A bad radiator can will cause antifreeze to leak onto your garage floor or driveway. &nbsp;If you go looking for it, and your A1 is equipped with electric fans, treat them like they could run at any time just to be safe.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Radiator Hose<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;There is a rubber hose that connects the radiator to the thermostat housing, and another one that connects the return from the engine block. &nbsp;These hoses can leak coolant from them as they dry out and crack.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Head Gasket<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;Your A1&#8217;s head gasket is designed to fail before permanent damage is done to the block or head when overheating. &nbsp;This does not mean that the head gasket will only fail if the engine has overheated. &nbsp;If the head gasket is blown, it could let coolant out of the engine onto the ground. &nbsp;It could also let coolant into the exhaust, which would manifest itself as white smoke.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cracked Head or Block<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;This would be the last thing that you&#8217;d want to look at on this list, as it&#8217;s far more likely that one of four issues listed above would be causing water to leak from your vehicle.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;A1 Leaking Water<\/h2>\n<p>Water itself, is often not a problem at all. &nbsp;If you have a coolant leak, that&#8217;s another thing entirely. &nbsp;Good luck diagnosing your Audi A1&#8217;s water leak. &nbsp;If there is anything you would like to add, please leave a comment below.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
