A bad blower motor usually causes this scenario. However, there are a few less common reasons as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t hear any noise coming from the blower motor, the air conditioner not working is going to be caused by one of the two items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bad Blower Motor (Most Likely)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blower motors are known to fail without warning. If all the dash lights are on, the climate control system looks like it should be working, and no air moves, you should suspect the blower motor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before replacing it, turn the fan up to its highest setting. You have a bad blower motor resistor if it starts blowing cold air on high.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to <a href=\"https:\/\/electrouniversity.com\/how-to-test-blower-motor-with-multimeter\/\">test a blower motor with a multimeter<\/a> (electrouniversity)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blower Motor Resistor<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Blower-Motor-Resistor.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Blower-Motor-Resistor-711x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-275880\" width=\"156\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Blower-Motor-Resistor-711x1024.jpg 711w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Blower-Motor-Resistor-208x300.jpg 208w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Blower-Motor-Resistor-768x1106.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Blower-Motor-Resistor.jpg 972w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 156px) 100vw, 156px\" \/><\/a><figcaption>Blower motor resistors come in many shapes and sizes<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the resistor in question, it will still be able to turn on the blower motor when you turn the speed all the way up. Sometimes, it\u2019ll still do nothing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can tell if the blower motor resistor has failed by testing for voltage where the harness plugs into the blower motor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We recommend testing the circuit for voltage at the blower motor first because it\u2019s almost always easier.&nbsp; A simple test light will usually do the trick.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If voltage goes to the blower motor, it\u2019ll need replacing.&nbsp; If there\u2019s no voltage, suspect the resistor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. AC System Not Blowing Cold Enough<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common reason for a car AC system that isn\u2019t blowing cold enough is low refrigerant levels, followed by a dirty evaporator, or condenser issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Refrigerant Leak<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover is-light\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim\"><\/span><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"585\" class=\"wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-275882\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Testing-AC-Car.jpg\" data-object-fit=\"cover\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Testing-AC-Car.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Testing-AC-Car-300x176.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Testing-AC-Car-768x449.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\"><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Testing the AC system pressure can help determine if you are chasing a leak or if there\u2019s another issue at work.&nbsp; If the A\/C system leaks, you can chase it down with a leak detection kit and UV dye.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Here\u2019s how to go about testing the pressure and chasing the leak:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How to Find AC Leaks in Your Car (UV Dye)\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/pCv7rCdcXsc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you add too much coolant, you can cause more leaks in the AC system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the refrigerant leaks out of the system, eventually, there won\u2019t be enough left to cool the vehicle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having the system recharged can temporarily get your AC system blowing cold again.&nbsp; But, the coolant will leak out again. As a result, the system pressure will diminish, and you\u2019ll have to repeat the cycle unless you discover WHY the system was leaking and repair it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blend Door Actuator<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The blend door actuator is responsible for adjusting how much air gets in from the A\/C system and the heater core.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blend door actuator may be bad or stuck if your AC system is not blowing cold air.&nbsp; Sometimes, when on an all-day trip, the blend door can freeze up, and it\u2019ll stay in whatever position it was in when frozen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When your A\/C is blowing WARMER than the outside temperature, it strongly indicates that the blend door actuator is causing the cooling issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what a bad blend door actuator sounds like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio\"><audio controls src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Bad-Blend-Door-Actuator.mp3\"><\/audio><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cooling Fan<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Cooling-Fans.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"555\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Cooling-Fans-1024x555.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-275884\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Cooling-Fans-1024x555.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Cooling-Fans-300x163.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Cooling-Fans-768x416.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Cooling-Fans.jpg 1376w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A defective cooling fan will cause a vehicle&#8217;s AC to stop working well.
