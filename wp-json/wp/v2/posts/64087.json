This is standard for any vehicle made in or after the 1996 model year.<\/p>\n<p>With P0741, the code gives you two reasons as to why the code has registered. They are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Performance<\/strong>&#8211; The clutch, like all clutches, is failing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stuck Off<\/strong>&#8211; Somewhere in the Aztec&#8217;s wiring, there is an error that is keeping the TCC from engaging.

Here&#8217;s a good video on how to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XzniUfjK6Aw\">diagnose and repair the TCC Solenoid<\/a>. This can be a tough problem for the shade tree mechanic to deal with. It involves a lot of checking for circuit resistance and testing the wiring. That being said, it sure doesn&#8217;t hurt to follow the wiring and see if you can find any noticeable issues. Here&#8217;s how to use <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2EeDwHk\">a scanner<\/a> to diagnose it:<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/QBkUD31ugc0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/li>\n<li><strong>Bad Torque Converter Clutch<\/strong>&#8211; The clutch itself can go bad, just like a manual transmission. The good news is that when this clutch goes out the transmission will still take you to where you need to go. Even if it does so at a slightly higher RPM.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Short in the TCC<\/strong>&#8211; A short in the wiring going from the TCC to the TCM can cause the P0741.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bad TCM<\/strong>&#8211; The transmission control module itself can be the cause of P0741 in your Aztec. Although, it&#8217;s probably not going to be the first place that you should check. The wiring should be the first place that you should check, as it will most likely be the problem.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>P0741 Symptoms- Pontiac Aztec<\/h2>\n<p>Here are the three main symptoms of P0741 in the Pontiac Aztec:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Decrease in MPG<\/strong>&#8211; Since the converter cannot lock properly, fuel efficiency will decrease as highway RPM increases.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Slightly Higher RPM at Speed<\/strong>&#8211; Increased RPM at higher speed is usually the most noticeable sign that there is something wrong with the TCC. It&#8217;ll feel like driving an older car. Locking torque converters only caught on in the late 70&#8217;s.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Service Engine Soon<\/strong>&#8211; Even if there are no other symptoms of the P0741 OBDII code in your Pontiac Aztec, the service engine soon light can cause it to fail inspection.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Good luck with the P0741 and your Pontiac Aztec.
