Each module has a specific system that it controls.  It&#8217;s commonly referred to as the BUS network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How many modules your Camry has depends on the model year and options that it has been equipped with.  As a rule, the newer the vehicle, the more modules it&#8217;ll have.  Here are some of the common modules that can be linked to the ECM:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Ignition system<\/li><li>TCM<\/li><li>Traction Control<\/li><li>ABS<\/li><li>VVT<\/li><li>Transmission Control<\/li><li>Cruise<\/li><li>Lane Assist\/Road Departure<\/li><li>Turbo Module<\/li><li>Windows\/Sunroof<\/li><li>Airbags\/Safety<\/li><li>Body Control Module<\/li><li>A\/C<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If ANY of them lose contact with the ECM, P0600 will be thrown, and the check engine light will come on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>P0600 Symptoms:  Toyota Camry<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The symptoms of P0600 will depend on which module lost communication with the ECM.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you have a transmission that isn&#8217;t shifting correctly, it&#8217;s fair to assume the transmission control module has lost communication.  <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Camry-airbag-light-on\/\">Airbag light<\/a>?  Inspect the airbag module and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Toyota Camry P0600 Causes &amp; Diagnosis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"P0600 Diagnosis\" class=\"wp-image-190153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before doing anything else, check to see if any other codes have appeared with P0600.  They can give you a clue as to which module is faulty.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if your Camry has code P0300, which is ignition-related, start by checking the ignition module.  <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0700-Toyota-Camry\/\">P0700<\/a> indicates an issue with the transmission control module, and you&#8217;d want to look at the connection between it and the ECM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are no other codes present, it&#8217;ll be tough to track down which module is causing the problem.  When this is the situation (and even if it&#8217;s not), we recommend taking it to a mechanic with specialized diagnostic equipment to access the BUS system.  They can make short work of diagnosing P0600.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>P0600 is most likely caused by the following three conditions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Module Connections<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Check where the module in question connects to the wiring harness.  Check to make sure that the pins are in good shape and corrosion-free.  The module wiring will often run through one or more BUS junctions before finding its way to the ECM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Ground<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Toyota Camry&#8217;s ECM, data BUS, and module in question both need a good ground to operate.  Verify that it is in good working order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Bad Module<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the module itself has gone bad and is not responsive, <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0600\/\" title=\"P0600 Code:  Meaning, Causes + Diagnosis\">P0600<\/a> will be thrown.  Wiring issues are more common than the module itself going bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The real problem with fixing P0600 in the Toyota Camry at home is that everything is so hard to get to (under the carpet, behind a panel, etc&#8230; )  We recommend taking it to a professional on this one (a very rare recommendation on this site).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>P0600 is a relatively uncommon OBD2 trouble code.
