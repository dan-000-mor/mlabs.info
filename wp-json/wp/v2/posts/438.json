\/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Transmission fluid is responsible for powering, lubricating, and cooling the transmission. \u00a0That&#8217;s a lot for one fluid to handle!<\/p>\n<p>A transmission with low fluid can become seriously damaged, and leave you stranded. \u00a0You really want to do anything that you can not to run your transmission if you think that it is critically low on fluid. \u00a0You&#8217;ll cause damage fast if it&#8217;s starting to slip from a low fluid condition.<\/p>\n<h4>Here are the signs that your transmission may have low fluid<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\u00a0<strong>Higher RPM at any given speed<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0If your engine seems to be revving higher than it should be at any particular speed than it may very well be a symptom of low transmission fluid.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Engine sounds different when going uphill<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0If you are going up a steep grade, you&#8217;ll find that the fluid may not be able to be picked up from the pan. \u00a0The motor will than rev higher.<\/li>\n<li><strong>High transmission temperature<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0An automatic transmission needs its fluid not just for converting mechanical energy to hydraulic in the torque converter; it also needs it for cooling purposes. \u00a0So, if you are lucky enough to have a transmission temperature gauge than you can take this as a warning. \u00a0Your transmission fluid is probably low.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Put car into gear, but it&#8217;s not going anywhere<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0 Often, if you let a car sit for a while, it&#8217;ll puke up a bunch of ATF. \u00a0So, it may have been full the last time you used the car, but low next time you go to use it. \u00a0The <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/turbo-hydramatic-350\/th350-transmission-identification\/\">TH350<\/a> has always been bad about this. \u00a0You&#8217;ll go to drive it somewhere and it&#8217;ll either not move at all or it&#8217;ll move only a little. \u00a0This can often be caused by a <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/signs-of-torque-converter-problems\/\">loose torque converter<\/a>. \u00a0Did you happen to notice a vibration at highway speed? \u00a0That&#8217;s also\u00a0a sign of a loose torque converter.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>What does Transmission Fluid do Anyway?<\/h3>\n<p>Transmission fluid is a hydraulic fluid that has three jobs:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It acts as a lubricant- \u00a0Just like motor oil it keeps the many complex mechanical parts inside of a transmission from wearing out.<\/li>\n<li>It cools the transmission- \u00a0Here it does the same job as antifreeze going through a motor. \u00a0It either makes<\/li>\n<li>It transfers power- \u00a0ATF transfers power from kinetic energy into hydraulic energy and back again through the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/signs-of-torque-converter-problems\/\">torque converter<\/a>. \u00a0It then transfers the power back to kinetic energy through the transmission and out the driveshaft. \u00a0This process is what allows a car to idle in gear not moving.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is different from a manual transmission, which uses oil for lubrication only. \u00a0It&#8217;s amazing that transmission fluid can go the life of some cars without a change.<\/p>\n<p><a

transmission fluid from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cartalk.com\/content\/service-your-car-14\">CarTalk<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Don&#8217;t let the Fluid Get Low- Check It!!<\/h3>\n<p>The best way to avoid low transmission fluid is to check it often and follow the factory maintenance schedule. \u00a0You should also visually inspect your transmission coolant lines. \u00a0They are often the culprit, as they are exposed underneath the vehicle. \u00a0Sometimes road debris can cut them. \u00a0They run to the radiator and back to the transmission, so if something happens to the radiator that can cause you to lose fluid. \u00a0Nearly every transmission will need to be checked at operating temperature. \u00a0If you check it when it&#8217;s cold you will get a false reading from the dipstick.<\/p>\n<p>You should always consult your owners manual for exact instructions on what to do with your particular transmission, \u00a0but\u00a0for most vehicles here is how you would check your fluid level:<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_499\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-499\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Check-Fluid-Level.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-499 size-medium\"

id=\"caption-attachment-499\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Make sure you have the engine at the proper temperature before checking your fluid.<\/strong><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<ul>\n<li>You want to make sure that the engine is both running and at operating temperature.<\/li>\n<li>The vehicle needs to be on a flat surface. \u00a0Don&#8217;t check \u00a0it on an incline.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Make sure you are aware of where all of your moving parts are before sticking your hand anywhere near a running engine. \u00a0You don&#8217;t want to lose a finger. \u00a0Safety first.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If your fluid levels are full, but you are experiencing these symptoms, than you should pay attention to the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/what-color-is-transmission-fluid\/\">color of your transmission fluid<\/a>. \u00a0Most transmission fluid is going to be a nice amber color. \u00a0As it ages it&#8217;s going to look like a dirty red. \u00a0This is generally will not cause the transmission to operate differently. \u00a0If it its black or burnt smelling than it&#8217;s definitely time to swap it out. \u00a0A good rule of thumb is that the nose knows. \u00a0If it smells burnt, than it is. \u00a0Change it before any lasting damage can occur<\/p>\n<p>If you keep up with your maintenance, than you&#8217;ll probably never need to worry about this. \u00a0But if you don&#8217;t, than it&#8217;s very nice to know the symptoms of\u00a0low transmission fluid. \u00a0Knowing them can save you thousands and keep you from being stranded on the side of the road, which can keep you and your family safe.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Automatic Transmissions have gotten so good since they were introduced\u00a0in the 1950\u2019s.\u00a0 In
