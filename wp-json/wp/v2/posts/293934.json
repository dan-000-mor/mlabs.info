P0441 is related to the evaporative emissions control system (EVAP) and should not be considered a breakdown risk when it&#8217;s the only code present. Your Accord&#8217;s ECM will trigger this code when it detects that the vacuum level in the Purge System is not flowing within the proper specifications.<\/p>\n<p>P0441 can cause your car to fail an emissions test.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>P0441 Quick Info<\/h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Honda-Accord.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Honda-Accord.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Accord P0441\" class=\"wp-image-272022\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Honda-Accord.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Honda-Accord-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Definition<\/strong><\/td><td>EVAP System &#8211; Incorrect Purge Flow<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Symptoms<\/strong><\/td><td>Gas smell, MIL light<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Common Causes<\/strong><\/td><td>Broken EVAP Hose, Bad Gas Cap, Purge Valve<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Breakdown Risk?<\/strong><\/td><td>No<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Repair Cost (Parts)<\/strong><\/td><td>Usually around $100 or under<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Repair Difficulty<\/strong><\/td><td>Medium<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>P0441 Definition: EVAP System &#8211; Incorrect Purge Flow<\/h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the definition of P0441 for the Honda Accord.&nbsp; It\u2019s a generic diagnostic trouble code, which means regardless of what auto manufacturer built the vehicle, it\u2019ll have the same meaning.&nbsp; It indicates that there is an issue with the Evaporative Emissions System.

They are presented (somewhat) in order from most to least easy to check:<\/p>\n<h3>Step 1: Inspect the Gas Cap<\/h3>\n<p>The gas cap going bad can cause P0441. This is due to the fuel tank not having the right amount of pressure with a bad cap. If you are getting a message to tighten your fuel cap when it is tightened already, you should replace the fuel cap before doing anything Twist the gas cap tight.&nbsp; Does it click tight?&nbsp; Wiggle it.&nbsp; Does it feel loose even when it&#8217;s snugged?&nbsp; Is the O-ring still in good shape?&nbsp; If not, it may need to be replaced.&nbsp; A gas cap is affordable and easy to replace.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Look at the Hoses<\/h3>\n<p>Start by locating the purge valve solenoid and tracing the lines that connect to it as far as they run.&nbsp; If any of them are cracked, broken, or disconnected, repair them and see if that clears P0441.&nbsp; If you live in a drier climate, or your Accord is older\/has high mileage, cracked hoses can throw P0441.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Test the Vacuum Line<\/h3>\n<p>It could be a vacuum leak causing this code.&nbsp; Listen to the engine running.&nbsp; Do you hear a hissing or whistling noise coming from anywhere?&nbsp; Vacuum leaks are pretty easy to detect as well. Here&#8217;s a good <a href=\"https:\/\/www.popularmechanics.com\/cars\/how-to\/a3094\/how-to-find-a-vacuum-leak\/\">article on how to find a vacuum leak<\/a> from <em>Popular Mechanics<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4:&nbsp; Inspect the Wiring Harness at the Purge Valve<\/h3>\n<p>Due to the location of the purge solenoid, it is not uncommon for the wiring going to it to fail.&nbsp; Verify that the wiring harness is plugged in all the way and that the harness isn&#8217;t cracked, broken, or otherwise damaged.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a great article from Backyard Mechanic that explains how to detect a short circuit if you think this may be the cause. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.backyardmechanic.org\/how-to-find-a-electrical-short-on-most-any-vehicle\/\">https:\/\/www.backyardmechanic.org\/how-to-find-a-electrical-short-on-most-any-vehicle\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 5: Test the Purge Valve<\/h3>\n<p>The purge valve is the most common issue that causes the P0441 trouble code in your Honda Accord. It\u2019s really easy to replace.&nbsp; Finding it and unhooking it is not that hard.&nbsp; There are a few clips that you need to find and remove.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You can command the purge valve to open and close if you have a good scan tool.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s an in-depth article from electron university on <a href=\"https:\/\/electrouniversity.com\/how-to-test-purge-valve-with-multimeter\/\">how to test a purge valve<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Other Causes<\/h3>\n<p>Here are issues that cause P0441 in the Accord that aren&#8217;t as common:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Failure of the purge flow sensor\/leak detection pump (whatever your Accord&#8217;s engine happens to be equipped with)<\/li>\n<li>PCM problems<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>How to Fix P0441 With a Scan Tool<\/h2>\n<p>If you have a quality scan tool, this video will show you how to diagnose and fix P0441 in your Accord using it. <iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/RCqFQbMhXUs\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>P0441 by itself is not going to make your Honda Accord break down.
