Bad Electric Fan<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-178727 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Engine-Cooling-Fan.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Engine-Cooling-Fan.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Engine-Cooling-Fan-300x194.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If the coolant level appears to be fine, then the next easiest thing to look at is the fan. &nbsp;Most vehicles use electric fans to cool the radiator when the vehicle gets warm enough. &nbsp;These fans are most important when the vehicle is idling. &nbsp;These fans can and do fail. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Solution<\/strong>: &nbsp;With the engine hot and idling (but not yet overheating) pop the hood open and see if the fan is turning. &nbsp;If it is not turning at all you know you have a bad fan.<\/p>\n<p>Check the fuse and fan relay to see if they are getting power. &nbsp;If they are, you&#8217;ll need to replace the fan.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. Bad Thermostat<\/h3>\n<p>Next on the list is the thermostat. &nbsp;The thermostat controls when coolant does and doesn&#8217;t enter the engine. &nbsp;It&#8217;ll either be on the block or water pump. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Solution<\/strong>: &nbsp;It can be tough to tell if a thermostat is bad without just replacing it. &nbsp;Does the vehicle get hot within a few minutes of driving (and the coolant is full)? &nbsp;That could be enough to tell that the thermostat isn&#8217;t opening all the way. &nbsp;It usually takes an engine a while to overheat when it is full of coolant.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to replace it, which is about a 2\/10 in mechanical difficulty. &nbsp;Most likely you&#8217;ll just need a ratchet, extension, and 10mm socket.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. Bad Water Pump<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-178733 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Water-Pump-Used.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Water-Pump-Used.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Water-Pump-Used-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The water pump in your car is turned by the engine&#8217;s accessory drive system. &nbsp;As the engine rpm increases, so does the speed of the water pump. &nbsp;When the vehicle is idle, the water pump is turning slowly. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Solution<\/strong>: A bad water pump isn&#8217;t efficient. &nbsp;When the car is overheating when idling the water pump is not able to move the coolant through the radiator and back to the engine. &nbsp;You can test this by putting the car in neutral or park and revving the engine to about 1000 RPM under the redline for a few seconds. &nbsp;You should see the temperature dip as the water pump spools up.<\/p>\n<p>Replacing a water pump is only as challenging as getting to it. &nbsp;Which, depending on it&#8217;s location, can be relatively easy or a total nightmare.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Honorable Mention: Temp Gauge<\/h3>\n<p>While a temperature gauge is usually pretty reliable, it still is an electrical device that can fail. &nbsp;A mechanic would check the temperature of the engine manually with a heat gun in order to ensure that the gauge was reading correctly before tackling the repair.<\/p>\n<p>When the car is overheating when idling and you SMELL the <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/the-advanced-vehicular-odor-guide\/\">smells associated<\/a> with a temp that is too high, you can throw the temp gauge theory out.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-178731 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Temp-Gauge.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Temp-Gauge.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Temp-Gauge-300x199.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Car Overheating When Idling<\/h2>\n<p>Hopefully, this guide to why vehicles overheat when idle helped you fix your vehicle. &nbsp;If there is anything that you would like to add that could help the next person with theirs, your comment below is most welcome.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are a few reasons that your car is overheating when idling. &nbsp;They include a bad thermostat, water pump, electric fans, and low coolant level. &nbsp;This guide is intended to help you find the cause of this overheating in the most efficient way possible. &nbsp;So, let&#8217;s start with what&#8217;s easy and take it from there. &#8230; <a title=\"Car Overheating When Idling:  Likely Causes + Solutions\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/car-overheating-when-idling-likely-causes-solutions\/\" aria-label=\"More on Car Overheating When Idling:  Likely Causes + Solutions\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/178726"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=178726"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/178726\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=178726"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=178726"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=178726"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
