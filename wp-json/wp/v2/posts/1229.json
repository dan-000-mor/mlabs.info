Problems"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>The 4T65E is for the most part a fairly reliable transmission.\u00a0 It is the successor to the 4T60E.\u00a0 Variations of this transmission have been common since

here are some of the most common 4T65E Problems.<\/p>\n<p>Before you go any further with your 4T65E diagnostic quest, make sure to hook in an OBDII reader if the service engine soon\/<a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/transmission-light-diagnosis\/\">transmission light<\/a> is on.\u00a0 The advanced diagnostics built into modern cars will often tell you the exact part that may need replaced, saving you a load of time.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Only 1&#8217;st, 2&#8217;nd, and Reverse Work<\/h2>\n<p>If you have a situation where Drive and 3&#8217;rd gear stop working entirely, you know how terrible it is to drive home with your vehicle screaming down the highway.\u00a0 The situation is most likely going to be caused by a broken forward apply band.<\/p>\n<h2>Harsh or Jarring Shifts<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most common issues with the 4T65E is that it&#8217;ll suddenly start shifting really hard.\u00a0 There are a few different issues that can cause this.\u00a0 The good news is that it usually throws a trouble code.\u00a0 The most common code is P1811.<\/p>\n<h3>P1811<\/h3>\n<p>In my experience, this is the most common code that registers for this problem.\u00a0 The ECM will begin registering this code whenever it detects shift times that are outside of its normal operating parameters.<\/p>\n<p>Once the code is thrown the transmission will begin to operate at maximum line pressure.\u00a0 While not a full <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/limp-mode-causes-and-solutions\/\">limp mode<\/a>, the transmission at full line pressure shifts incredibly hard.\u00a0 The reasoning for this is the shorter shift time will save the transmission<\/p>\n<p>The real problem with harsh shifting is that many issues can cause it.\u00a0 Most of them have to do with the transmission being just wore out.\u00a0 Here are the most common ones.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>MAF sensor causing the transmission lower command line pressure to be to low.\u00a0 This creates sluggish shifts do to lack of pressure.<\/li>\n<li>Valve body wear.<\/li>\n<li>Clutch wear.<\/li>\n<li>Bad Pressure Control Solenoid.<\/li>\n<li>Worn or bad seals and rings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a great video all about what causes the P811 code.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ZVpIFS-LjQ4\"

whenever you put it into gear, it&#8217;s a good idea to start with the <strong>transmission fluid<\/strong>.\u00a0 It could be out or extremely low.\u00a0 Get to know the signs of <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/low-transmission-fluid-signs\/\">low transmission fluid<\/a> so that it doesn&#8217;t happen again.<\/p>\n<p>A <strong>broken shift linkage<\/strong> could also be responsible for the vehicle not moving in gear.\u00a0 This is espescially worth considering if you recently had some ice or a hard freeze.\u00a0 The linkage can freeze.\u00a0 It&#8217;s not very common, but it certainly can.\u00a0 Typically, when this happens it should feel like the shifter is stuck until you break it free.\u00a0 But what has really happened is the shifter has been pulled off of the linkage.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Won&#8217;t Move When Warmed Up<\/h2>\n<p>This has to be one of the most baffling things that can happen to someone.\u00a0 The scenario would be that the vehicle works fine when cold, but whenever it warms up, the transmission just stops working.<\/p>\n<p>This is most commonly cause by the damage to the transmission filter caused by damage to the torque converter.\u00a0 It&#8217;s a chain reaction that can leave you stranded.\u00a0 The maddening thing is that the 4T65E will work fine again when it gets cold.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Reverse Failure<\/h2>\n<p>Reverse hardly ever fails on these transmissions.\u00a0 When it does, it&#8217;s almost always something that you&#8217;re going to have to open the transmission up to investigate.\u00a0Here are the most common issues that may cause reverse failure in the 4T65E include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reverse Apply Servo- Sealing lip seal may be failing<\/li>\n<li>Reverse Boost Valve- Worn so much it&#8217;s stopped engaging<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>These are some of the most common issues and problems with the 4T65E.\u00a0 If you have a question I might be able to answer feel free to leave a comment or use the contact page.\u00a0 Remember, while these are the most problems and solutions, there are any number of less common things that can cause the same issues.\u00a0 When in doubt, take it to a professional.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The 4T65E is for the most part a fairly reliable
