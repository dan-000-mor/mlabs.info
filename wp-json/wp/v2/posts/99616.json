Just because the vehicle can be driven, does not mean that the problem should be ignored. &nbsp;Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you start your vehicle, the computer system runs a diagnostic check of all major systems. &nbsp;If any of these checks fail, you will see a diagnostic warning light on the dash. &nbsp;When the airbag system fails this check, you&#8217;ll see the airbag light.
