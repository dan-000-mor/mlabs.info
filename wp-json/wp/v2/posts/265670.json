From there, it burns off cleanly.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Lincoln&#8217;s PCM performs a test on the EVAP check valve during light boost conditions, one time per drive cycle.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is checking to see if the fuel tank pressure exceeds the calibrated amount or if the fuel tank vacuum is less than the calibrated amount for a certain amount of time.  If it doesn&#8217;t see the proper values, <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p144c-ford\/\" title=\"Ford P144C:  Meaning, Causes, + Diagnosis\">P144C<\/a> is triggered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>P144C Symptoms:  Lincoln Navigator<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The only symptom you should expect to see with P144C is the <strong>check engine light<\/strong>.

If P144C is intermittent, it can be challenging to chase down.  You can start by inspecting the EVAP hoses.  After that, you can use a scanner to command the purge valve to open and close.
