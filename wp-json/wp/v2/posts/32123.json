They are presented loosely in order from most to least likely:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>MAF Sensor Dirty<\/strong>&#8211;  Over the course of its life, the MAF sensor will often get so covered in grime that it&#8217;ll no longer get an accurate reading.  They can be cleaned, but it&#8217;s easy to mess one up, and you don&#8217;t want to use a wire brush.  Here&#8217;s a great article on exactly how to clean one from <em>Family Handyman.<\/em>  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.familyhandyman.com\/automotive\/car-maintenance\/mass-air-flow-sensor-maf-cleaning\/view-all\/\">MAF Sensor Cleaning<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>MAF Sensor Failure<\/strong>&#8211;  While it is very likely that the MAF sensor itself could be the problem, it&#8217;s absolutely necessary to test it before you replace it.  Here&#8217;s a video on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O4pBu3uRlYA\">how to test one without pulling it<\/a>.  This is important for two reasons.  The first is that they are expensive.  The second is that it only takes a few minutes to test it with a multimeter.  If you do need one, they are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=aps&amp;field-keywords=maf+sensor+Opel+Astra&amp;rh=i:aps,k:maf+sensor+Opel+Astra&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=e881af2e6892f9a744d45357a662422b&amp;language=en_US\">pretty reasonable on Amazon<\/a>.  Just make sure you check to make sure it fits your year Astra before purchasing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Intake Manifold\/Vacuum Leak<\/strong>&#8211;  If there is a leak in the intake manifold, it will be impossible for the MAF sensor to get an accurate reading.  Without knowing how much air is really getting into the engine, P0101 will be thrown.<\/li>\n<li><strong>MAF Sensor Wiring<\/strong>&#8211;  Make sure to check around the MAF sensor for opens or shorts.  Start by inspecting the wiring harness for obvious damage.  If you don&#8217;t see any you can use a multimeter to test the wiring.  At this point if you use the YouTube video above in the MAF sensor dirty section, and there turns out to be no voltage at all, try checking out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.backyardmechanic.org\/how-to-find-a-electrical-short-on-most-any-vehicle\/\">How to Find an Electrical Short on Most Any Vehicle<\/a> from BackYardMechanic<\/li>\n<li><strong>Clogged Catalytic Converter<\/strong>&#8211;  If you are getting P0101 in your Astra accompanied by a noticeable lack in power at speed, it may very well be that you have a clogged catalytic converter<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Whatever the reason for P0101 in your Opel Astra, ignoring it is a bad idea.
