&nbsp;Your Envoy may run rich or lean when idling, or it may also idle erratically. &nbsp;A rich condition is when there is not enough air relative to the fuel in the air\/fuel mixture. &nbsp;The exhaust color is usually darker when running rich. &nbsp;A lean condition is when there is too much air relative to fuel in the air fuel mixture. &nbsp;The exhaust color usually doesn&#8217;t change.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hard to Start<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;Without knowing the proper amount of air entering into the intake, it can be really difficult for the engine to start. &nbsp;And when it does, it doesn&#8217;t usually run very well.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Jerking<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;As you go down the road, you&#8217;ll feel your Envoy really jerk and hesitate as the engine speed changes erratically. &nbsp;It&#8217;s bad for your motor mounts when this happens. &nbsp;Also, jerking can be caused by <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-spark-plug-symptoms-GMC-Envoy\/\">bad spark plugs<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-coil-pack-symptoms-GMC-Envoy\/\">coil packs<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Decreased Fuel Mileage<\/strong>&#8211;
