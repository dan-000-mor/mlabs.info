Here it is separated into its separate pieces, with a quick explanation of each.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Camshaft Position Timing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Overhead-Camshaft.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Overhead-Camshaft.jpg\" alt=\"P0011 Meaning\" class=\"wp-image-177842\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Overhead-Camshaft.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Overhead-Camshaft-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Camshaft position timing how your Toyota Avensis&#8217;s intake and exhaust valves close relative to the location of the crankshaft. The camshaft&#8217;s position is constant relative to the crank\u2019s position on vehicles that don\u2019t have variable valve timing. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vehicles with VVT can change camshaft position timing depending on whether you need power or economy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Over Advanced or System Performance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>VVT allows the engine to act as though it has different camshaft profiles at different RPMs; this is great for both power and fuel economy. Sometimes, the system will get stuck in an over-advanced position.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When this happens, your Toyota Avensis will store trouble code P0011.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Valve timing control methods can be quite different for every engine, even from the same manufacturer, but the basics are the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Camshaft actuators or phasers change how long the intake and exhaust valves stay open. They are hydraulic, which means that they use the vehicle\u2019s engine oil to change the intake valve timing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some simpler systems change the cam timing, while others change cam profiles entirely. Here\u2019s a detailed write-up on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.austincc.edu\/wkibbe\/vvt.htm\">exactly how VVT works<\/a> if you\u2019re interested in learning more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bank 1<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bank one is the side of the engine with the first cylinder. If your Avensis has an inline engine, you don\u2019t need to concern yourself with this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Avensis has a \u201cV\u201d engine with two cylinder heads, you\u2019ll need to look up which side is bank 1. It\u2019s usually the cylinder head closer to the front of the engine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Toyota Avensis P0011 Symptoms<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis.png\" alt=\"P0011 Symptoms\" class=\"wp-image-87467\" width=\"212\" height=\"212\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Service-Engine-Soon-Light-Diagnosis-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When the cam timing is off, it can cause some issues with the motor.

Sometimes the P0011 fix is as easy as topping off the oil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the most common causes, presented to you in order from the easiest thing to check to the most difficult:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Engine Oil<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/How-Long-for-a-Shop-Oil-Change.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/How-Long-for-a-Shop-Oil-Change.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-202526\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/How-Long-for-a-Shop-Oil-Change.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/How-Long-for-a-Shop-Oil-Change-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/How-Long-for-a-Shop-Oil-Change-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing you should do is check your Avensis\u2019s oil. There are three ways that it can cause P0011:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Low Oil<\/strong>: The most common cause of P0011 is low oil. It needs to be low enough to lower the engine\u2019s oil pressure (which is really low).<\/li><li><strong>Dirty Oil<\/strong>: If the oil and\/or oil filter haven\u2019t been changed in a long time, sometimes it can cause the camshaft actuator to clog up with sludge.<\/li><li><strong>Wrong Viscocity (Too Thick or Too Thin)<\/strong>:&nbsp; If you recently had an oil change and your Avensis now has this code, change the oil again, and verify that the shop used the right oil.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bad Intake Camshaft Position Actuator or Actuator Solenoid<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The actuator solenoid itself can go bad over time. You certainly don\u2019t want to start here since, a lot of the time, it\u2019ll be something else that causes the P0011 to appear. Here\u2019s a good video that explains how to test the camshaft actuator using a scan tool:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Fixing engine code P0011,P0010\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/KRCUuGk3hPU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Engine Timing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Avensis&#8217;s camshaft(s) are no longer synced to the crank properly (such as if the timing chain jumped a tooth), it can cause the engine timing to be off enough to throw the P0011, even though it\u2019s not the actuator\u2019s fault. Here\u2019s more on that from this site:<a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/timing-chain-jumped-symptoms-and-diagnosis\/\"> Timing Chain Jumped Symptoms and Diagnosis<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wiring Issues<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The wiring from the solenoid to the ECM can become damaged or broken, this will throw the P0011 OBDII code.
