This allows for a more efficient cam profile (better power and fuel economy). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Camshaft Position Actuator<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Camshaft Position Actuators can change the lift of a camshaft up to 25 degrees. They are hydraulic, which means that they use the vehicle&#8217;s engine oil to control lift. So, if you have low oil pressure or dirty oil, it can keep them from doing their job properly and trigger P0010.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When these camshaft actuators go bad, the engine will no longer be able to change the valve timing properly, and there may be a noticeable loss of fuel economy and power.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Circuit<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The voltage value coming from the camshaft position actuator at Bank 1 is outside its normal operating parameters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bank 1<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bank one is the side of the engine with the first cylinder.
