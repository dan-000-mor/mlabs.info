Villager:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Exhaust<\/h3>\n<p>The exhaust system is one of the most common culprits that can make it sound like your Mercury Villager&#8217;s engine is rattling. &nbsp;While the exhaust is outside of the engine itself, it can often cause sounds that are confused for an internal engine rattle.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Heat Shield<\/h4>\n<p>The number one rattling culprit in your Villager&#8217;s exhaust system is the <strong>heat shield<\/strong>. &nbsp;They can get a little loose as the vehicle ages and accumulates mileage. &nbsp;Once this happens, it&#8217;ll rattle all of the time. &nbsp;It&#8217;s particularly noticeable when you rev the engine in neutral and let off of the gas pedal. &nbsp;You should hear a rattle as the engine comes back down from the higher RPM.<\/p>\n<p>If the heat shield is loose, you&#8217;ll need to take your Villager into a good exhaust shop and have it welded back into place. &nbsp;The good news is that a loose heat shield is never going to leave you broken down on the side of the road.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Engine-Rattling-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-106380\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Engine-Rattling-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"Mercury Villager Engine Rattling Diagnosis\" width=\"353\" height=\"332\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Exhaust Leak<\/h4>\n<p>If your exhaust system is leaking, it will often make an aggressive ticking sound. &nbsp;Some folks have described it as a rattle. &nbsp;If it is leaking, the most common place that it leaks from is going to be where it bolts to the block at the exhaust manifolds. &nbsp;You can check and see if any of the exhaust manifold bolts have broken off. &nbsp;This is very common in all vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Catalytic Converter<\/h4>\n<p>The catalytic converter is responsible for scrubbing the majority of the pollutants out of your exhaust. &nbsp;As it ages, the metals inside can break down. &nbsp;When this happens, you can hear them rattle around.<\/p>\n<p>When the <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Mercury-Villager-catalytic-converter\/\">catalytic converter<\/a> does fail, it&#8217;ll often give you code <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0420-Mercury-Villager\/\">P0420<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0430-Mercury-Villager\/\">P0430<\/a>. &nbsp;If your check engine light is on, you may want to see if you have an emissions related code. &nbsp;That would be very strong evidence that the catalytic converter is causing the problem.<\/p>\n<p>Most auto parts stores are happy to scan your codes free of charge. &nbsp;Otherwise, scanners are <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2WoLYe1\">really cheap<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Timing Chain<\/h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Mercury-Villager-bad-timing-belt\/\">loose timing chain<\/a> can really make a rattling sound. &nbsp;This sound is particularly noticeable when you start the Villager. &nbsp;A bad tensioner will leave the chain loose and ready to jump a tooth or fall off all of the way. &nbsp;While it&#8217;s most noticeable at startup, that doesn&#8217;t mean that you won&#8217;t be able to hear it all times. &nbsp;Sometimes you can, sometimes you can&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Timing-Belt.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-102160\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Timing-Belt.jpg\" alt=\"Engine Rattling Fix Villager\" width=\"300\" height=\"506\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Loose Accessory<\/h3>\n<p>If something has worked its way loose on your engine, it can rattle and dance at different RPMs. &nbsp;If you&#8217;ve left your oil cap loose on top of the valve cover, that can cause a rattling sound. &nbsp;Or, if you&#8217;ve left a tool on top of the intake or valve cover it can cause a rattling sound. &nbsp;It doesn&#8217;t even need to be something loose, it can just be out of place.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Oil<\/h3>\n<p>This seems obvious, but it&#8217;s worth checking out. &nbsp;If there is no oil in the crankcase, the engine is going to sound like a rattling old buzzsaw. &nbsp;That rattling sound is the sound of your Villager&#8217;s engine dying.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Mercury-Villager-blown-head-gasket\/\">blown head gasket<\/a>, you could be losing water that goes into the crankcase. &nbsp;When this happens the oil loses its viscosity as it is watered down. &nbsp;The oil will look orange and foamy when this is the case.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Internal Engine Issue<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been looking for all of the issues described above, it could be that there is something inside of the engine that is making it rattle. &nbsp;You could have a stuck lifter, a burnt valve, the wrong spark plugs, or more. &nbsp;Hopefully, one of the easier to fix and more common issues listed above though.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Villager Engine Rattling<\/h2>\n<p>Good luck fixing the rattle coming from your Mercury
