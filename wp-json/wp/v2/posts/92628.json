&nbsp;Once brakes heat up so far, they begin to glaze. &nbsp;This process leaves them unable to stop your Spectra as efficiently as they once did. &nbsp;It also produces a rather strong smell. &nbsp;Most folks say it smells like rotten eggs<\/li>\n<li><strong>Loss of Fuel Mileage<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;If your Spectra&#8217;s brake calipers are stuck even a little bit, fuel mileage will suffer as the engine has to make up for the constant drag coming from the brakes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pulling to one side<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;When one brake is stuck (particularly a front brake) the whole vehicle will pull in the direction of the bad brake. &nbsp;So if it is on the passenger side, your Spectra will feel like it is steering in that direction.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Smoke<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;When you finish driving, the brakes can get so hot from being stuck that smoke begins to billow out from behind the wheel. &nbsp;If you see this, it&#8217;s almost a certainty that the brakes are stuck, and you shouldn&#8217;t drive the vehicle until it has been repaired.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Screen-Shot-2019-09-11-at-11.14.41-AM.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-90288\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Screen-Shot-2019-09-11-at-11.14.41-AM.png\" alt=\"Kia Spectra Brake Caliper Sticking\" width=\"300\" height=\"270\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Kia Spectra Sticking Brakes Causes<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Brake Caliper Bolts<\/h3>\n<p>One of the most common causes of sticking brakes is caliper bolts. &nbsp;These bolts have to hold the caliper in place, while at the same time allowing for some movement.<\/p>\n<p>Brake caliper bolts are protected by a rubber boot. &nbsp;This rubber boot protects them from the elements and assures that they stay lubricated. &nbsp;Replacing these bolts is not very challenging.<\/p>\n<h3>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<h3>Caliper Slides<\/h3>\n<p>There are notches in your Spectra&#8217;s brake pads that let them slide back and forth from the rotor as the brakes are pressed. &nbsp;If something gets into these slides, the pads may not disengage from the rotor all the way.<\/p>\n<p>This problem is often caused by bad shims or junk getting in the way. &nbsp;When this happens, the pads are almost certainly going to be worn incorrectly. &nbsp;As you replace the shims and clean everything up, go ahead and replace the pads too.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Caliper Pistons<\/h3>\n<p>Your Spectra&#8217;s disk brakes use pistons to push the brake pad into the rotor. &nbsp;These pistons have a rubber seal around them. &nbsp;This seal can go bad and the piston will start to lose its free movement. &nbsp;If this is the case, the caliper will almost always need to be replaced.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Brake Hose<\/h3>\n<p>The brake hose that attaches to the Spectra&#8217;s caliper will often cause the brakes to stick. &nbsp;They may appear to be fine on the outside, but can break apart and collect debris on the inside.<\/p>\n<p>When this happens, it effectively traps pressure in the line. &nbsp;This keeps the brakes from releasing all of the way, and they stick as a result. &nbsp;Replacing the hose is easy. &nbsp;We recommend if you have to do one, you may as well do all of them. &nbsp;You&#8217;ll need to bleed the brakes afterwards.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Crimped Brake Line<\/h3>\n<p>If something has pushed a metal brake line into the chassis it can cause a crimp. &nbsp;Most of the time, this is done by someone with a floor jack really not paying attention to what they are doing. &nbsp;If this happens, you&#8217;ll need to replace the entire affected brake line.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Kia Spectra Brakes Sticking<\/h2>\n<p>Your Spectra&#8217;s braking system is the most important part of the vehicle. &nbsp;If it is sticking, and you can&#8217;t easily figure out why, take it to a reputable shop. &nbsp;If there is anything that you would like to add, please leave a comment below. &nbsp;Good luck!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
