If your Jeep Wrangler&#8217;s fuel pump goes bad, no fuel (or not enough fuel depending on whether or not it&#8217;s out all the way) can enter the engine. &nbsp;Without gas your Wrangler will not run at all. &nbsp;With that in mind, most of the <strong>symptoms<\/strong> of a bad fuel pump revolve around the vehicle stalling out or not running at all.<\/p>\n<p>In modern fuel injected vehicles, the fuel pump sits right in the fuel tank and &#8220;pushes&#8221; the gasoline to the fuel rail(s). &nbsp;It is in the fuel tank because &#8220;pushing&#8221; fuel to the fuel rail is easier than &#8220;pulling&#8221; the fuel, which is what an inline pump would do. &nbsp;While being in the fuel tank makes the pump more reliable, it also makes it a lot more difficult to get to.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that fuel <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=fuel+pump+Jeep+Wrangler&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=40e547092b3c43a3becdb4af6d34e51d&amp;language=en_US\">pumps are inexpensive<\/a>. &nbsp;The bad news is that they cost a lot in terms of labor to repair and replace.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Jeep Wrangler Bad Fuel Pump Symptoms<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Fuel-Pump-Symptoms.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-75099\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Fuel-Pump-Symptoms.jpg\" alt=\"Jeep Wrangler Bad Fuel Pump Symptoms\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Fuel-Pump-Symptoms.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Fuel-Pump-Symptoms-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">There are physical signs that you can feel when your Wrangler&#8217;s fuel pump is going out.&nbsp; &nbsp;Before taking anything apart, check to see if your engine&#8217;s computer has any trouble codes saved in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The engine may throw a P0087 trouble code.&nbsp; This trouble code detects that the fuel rail\/system pressure is too low.&nbsp; Any trouble codes that exist could be a clue.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes when there is low fuel pressure, you may also get an oxygen sensor related trouble code as well.&nbsp; The real issue with diagnosing a bad fuel pump is that it resembles many other vehicular issues in terms of symptoms. &nbsp;Also, the symptoms are almost exactly the same as <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Jeep-Wrangler-bad-fuel-filter\/\">bad\/clogged fuel filter<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the most common symptoms of a bad fuel pump in your <strong>Jeep Wrangler<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Whining Noise<\/h3>\n<p>One of the most common signs that a fuel pump is going bad is a whining sound. &nbsp;The whining sound can indicate that the fuel pump is going out before there are any performance based issues. &nbsp;Keeping an open ear can save you from getting stuck somewhere with a bad fuel pump. &nbsp;It&#8217;ll sound like a low frequency buzzing sound.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>&nbsp;Sputtering Under Acceleration<\/h3>\n<p>The only way that you are going to know that your Wrangler&#8217;s fuel pump is going out is that it is no longer providing enough fuel pressure to keep the engine running under a heavy load, or at high-speed. &nbsp;Typically, if you are heading up a hill (or accelerating) the engine may start to feel like it is just running out of steam.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what it feels like with a bad fuel pump. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now, a bad fuel pump can also feel a heck of a lot like a bad catalytic converter.&nbsp; Both conditions will make the motor feel like it is running out of wind when you hit the gas. &nbsp;A bad catalytic converter will not feel as jarring.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a smooth lack of power.&nbsp; If you are unsure, check out this article on <a style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.dummies.com\/home-garden\/car-repair\/fuel-system\/how-to-troubleshoot-catalytic-converters\/\">troubleshooting catalytic converters<\/a><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">. &nbsp;If you get<a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0420-Jeep-Wrangler\/\"> P0420<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0430-Jeep-Wrangler\/\">P0430<\/a> trouble codes with a scanner, it very well may be the catalytic converter causing these symptoms.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Challenges Starting the Engine<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best indicators of a clogged fuel pump is going to be that the your Wrangler is difficult to start.&nbsp; This because there&#8217;s not enough fuel pressure to properly atomize the fuel as it enters the combustion chamber.<\/p>\n<p>If your Wrangler is difficult to start, a bad fuel pump would probably not be the place to start looking, especially if you are&#8217;t getting a fuel related trouble code.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, we&#8217;d recommend taking a look at the ignition system first.&nbsp; Often it&#8217;ll be <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-spark-plug-symptoms-Jeep-Wrangler\/\">bad spark plugs<\/a>, or a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.carsdirect.com\/car-repair\/how-to-tell-if-you-have-a-faulty-coil-pack\">bad coil pack<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Engine Won&#8217;t Start<\/h3>\n<p>If the fuel pump has completely failed, the engine won&#8217;t start at all.<\/p>\n<p>At the most basic of levels your Jeep Wrangler needs three things to start:&nbsp; <strong>Air<\/strong>, <strong>fuel<\/strong>, and <strong>spark<\/strong>.&nbsp; If any of these things aren&#8217;t present, the engine won&#8217;t turn over at all. &nbsp;If there&#8217;s been zero warning that the fuel pump could be going bad (hesitation, difficulty starting, etc) then it should not be automatically assumed that the fuel pump is at fault.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a great youtube video on how to test a fuel filter:<\/p>\n<p>d<br \/>\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/mDIlwbx0B-s\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>It Could Also be Your Wrangler&#8217;s Fuel Filter<\/h2>\n<p>A fuel pump that is going out is going to feel the same as a bad fuel filter.&nbsp; This makes telling if you have a bad fuel pump vs bad fuel filter very challenging.<\/p>\n<p>How do you tell them apart?&nbsp; A clogged fuel filter will have high pressure on its input side and low pressure on its output side. &nbsp;A bad fuel pump will have low pressure on both sides.<\/p>\n<p>They are both going to cause the same hesitation at high speed and difficulty starting.&nbsp; The only way to truly tell is to place a fuel pressure gauge on both sides of the line and get a reading from both.<\/p>\n<p>If your car isn&#8217;t starting at all, and you hear the fuel pump prime that is usually a good indication that the pump is working to some capacity. &nbsp;Testing your Wrangler&#8217;s fuel pressure on each side of the pump would be the best way to diagnose this problem.<\/p>\n<p>A priming fuel pump sounds like a high-pitched whine for a few seconds and can be heard with a sharp engine right after the ignition key is turned, but before the starter is engaged.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Jeep Wrangler Bad Fuel Pump<\/h2>\n<p>The symptoms of a bad fuel pump match a lot of other common problems that can occur in the Jeep Wrangler. &nbsp;Testing the pump and pressure on each side of it are going to be the quickest ways to rule it out. &nbsp;If there is anything you would like to add, please leave a comment below. &nbsp;Good luck!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
