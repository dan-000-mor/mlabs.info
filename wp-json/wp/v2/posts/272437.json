Check the AAT Wiring<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You should start by looking at the Ambient Air Temperature (AAT) sensor, connection, and wires. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the AAT wiring harness is damaged (which frequently happens due to its location), repair it and see if that clears the code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can read these things using a Digital Volt-Ohm Meter (DVOM) and a thermometer. Check the vehicle manual for proper readings, and if they differ significantly from your readings, replace the sensor. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find the correct readings inside or very close to the front bumper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Check the AAT Sensor Itself<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow through with and eliminate any other error codes before focusing on P0073. Examine the sensor itself to ensure it doesn&#8217;t look physically damaged. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, repositioning or cleaning out the terminals is the solution, but typically the culprit is a connection issue or bad sensor, whether it\u2019s exposed or burnt wires.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some brands and models notorious for having P0073 code issues:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Dodge<\/li><li>Ford<\/li><li>Jeep<\/li><li>BMW<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3>How Serious is a P0073 Code?&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This code\/problem will not affect the engine, steering, brakes, fuel consumption, or the vehicle\u2019s overall ability to go from point A to point B. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What it will cause, depending on where the vehicle is situated, is an inconvenience. The lack of air conditioning and the inability to read the outside temperature could become a major nuisance for those located in areas with hotter climates.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number one thing P0073 affects is the auto start features climate control.  If it&#8217;s hot out, the A\/C will kick on.  If it&#8217;s cold, the PCM will activate the heater.  Most vehicles still allow you to manually control the A\/C if there is an issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other Related Codes&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other codes associated with P0073. You should follow the same steps to diagnose these related issues. Check to eliminate other codes and visually inspect the sensor and the circuits that connect to the sensor for these potential issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>P0070 \u201cAmbient Air Temperature Sensor Circuit Malfunction\u201d<\/li><li>P0071 \u201cAmbient Air Temperature Sensor Range\/Performance\u201d<\/li><li>P0072 \u201cAmbient Air Temperature Sensor Circuit Low Input\u201d<\/li><li>P0074 \u201cAmbient Air Temperature Sensor Circuit Intermittent\u201d<\/li><\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>P0073 is one of the most prevalent OBD2 trouble codes.
