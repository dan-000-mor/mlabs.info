is one of the most common warning messages that the Ford Falcon will produce. &nbsp;Really, what this message means is check the fuel cap.&nbsp; More than likely, it hasn&#8217;t been secured.&nbsp; It will often show up even though the fuel cap appears to be on and secured, that&#8217;s what this article aims to address.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;Check Fuel Inlet&#8221; Meaning<\/h2>\n<p>The check fuel inlet indicator means that the ECM has detected a pressure leak in your Falcon&#8217;s fuel tank. &nbsp;Far and away the most common reason for this problem is that the fuel cap itself is missing, not tightened enough, or damaged in some way.&nbsp; It sends the check fuel inlet message for you to check the most likely place that it would be leaking, the fuel inlet\/cap.<\/p>\n<p>If this has happened to your Ford, make sure you put the cap back on someplace safe. &nbsp;There is no immediate danger, and therefore no reason to pull off the road someplace dangerous to do this.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;Check Fuel Inlet&#8221; Symptoms: &nbsp;Ford Falcon<\/h2>\n<p>Your Falcon will still run and drive just fine. &nbsp;The only thing you may notice is the slight <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Ford-Falcon-smells-like-gas\/\">smell of fuel<\/a> (particularly if your tank is full). &nbsp;If you do smell fuel, that confirms that the check fuel inlet message is accurate. &nbsp;If it was snugged down, replacing the fuel cap would be the most likely fix. &nbsp;They are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=Ford+Falcon+fuel+cap&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=5224a769c1a8d9f8fd7919a452be49f4&amp;language=en_US\">very affordable<\/a>&nbsp;(usually around twenty bucks).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;Check Fuel Inlet&#8221; Causes<\/h2>\n<p>Most of the causes related to the check fuel inlet message are going to actually be issues with the gasl cap itself.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_97886\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-97886\" style=\"width: 190px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Gas-Cap.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-97886\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Gas-Cap.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"190\"><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-97886\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A bad gas cap is one of the top reasons people smell gas coming from their vehicle<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h3>Gas Cap Issues<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Missing Fuel Cap<\/strong>&#8211;&nbsp;This often happens after a fill up. &nbsp;With no fuel cap on the message will populate right away. &nbsp;Replacing the fuel cap will clear the message.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Loose Fuel Cap<\/strong>&#8211;&nbsp;When tightening a fuel cap, it needs to be tightened until there is a satisfying click. &nbsp;If that click is no longer being felt, it is time to replace it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bad Fuel Cap<\/strong>&#8211;&nbsp;There is a rubber seal in the gas cap that snugs against the fuel inlet. &nbsp;If this gasket has gone bad the fuel vapor will be able to escape through the cracks and the &#8220;Check Fuel Inlet&#8221; light\/warning message will appear.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>EVAP Leak<\/h3>\n<p>Your fuel tank is part of your Falcon&#8217;s larger Evaporative Emissions Control (EVAP) System. &nbsp;There is a certain amount of pressure in the tank. &nbsp;This pressure is secured by the fuel cap.<\/p>\n<p>Your Ford&#8217;s computer will throw the &#8220;Check Fuel Inlet&#8221; warning when it detects that the pressure has changed enough that it&#8217;s likely that there is a gas cap leak. &nbsp;Otherwise, it would have thrown an EVAP related trouble code (most likely <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0457-Ford-Falcon\/\">P0457<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;Check Fuel Inlet&#8221; Fix<\/h2>\n<p>Check to make sure that the fuel cap is tightened. &nbsp;If it was loose, you&#8217;ll need to snug it. &nbsp;It may not immediately turn off the fuel cap warning. &nbsp;Drive your Falcon for a couple days. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If it still does not clear you should inspect the gas cap for any damage. &nbsp;Take a good look at the O-ring. &nbsp;If it is missing or damaged, replace the cap.<\/p>\n<p>If the gas cap is OK and the message is not going away there is likely a leak in the EVAP system.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>How to Check the Fuel Cap<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Open the Falcon&#8217;s fuel door.<\/li>\n<li>Twist the fuel cap to the left until it disengages from the fuel fill nozzle.<\/li>\n<li>Put the cap back on. &nbsp;Make sure the threads are lined up correctly and twist to the right until there is a click.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Is it Safe to Drive With &#8220;Check Fuel Inlet&#8221;?<\/h2>\n<p>It is safe to drive with the gas cap light on. &nbsp;In fact, it&#8217;s a lot safer than pulling over to the side of the road. &nbsp;Your Falcon has a built in flapper valve that will keep the fuel in the tank even if the cap is entirely missing.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Ford Falcon &#8220;Check Fuel Inlet&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Gas caps can and do go bad. &nbsp;They are not made to last the entire life of the vehicle (although some often do).<\/p>\n<p>The check fuel inlet warning is almost always caused by a bad or loose gas cap. &nbsp;It sometimes can indicate an EVAP leak. &nbsp;If there is anything that you could add to help the next person reading this article, please leave a comment below. &nbsp;Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Check Fuel Inlet&#8221;
