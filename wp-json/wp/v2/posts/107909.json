Transmission Pan\/Gasket<\/h3>\n<p>The <strong>transmission pan<\/strong> takes a lot of abuse over the years.&nbsp; It is always low and close to the road.&nbsp; Eventually a rock or other type of road hazard can damage it to the point that is no longer sealed.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=Toyota+Land Cruiser+transmission+pan+gasket&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=9741f3effbf3bac816bea235e8fe9415&amp;language=en_US\">transmission gasket<\/a> is another point where the transmission can leak a lot of fluid in a short amount of time.&nbsp; The gasket can get brittle with enough time and heat applied to it.&nbsp; Or, it could have been damaged if you&#8217;ve recently had your transmission fluid changed.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing to look for, particularly if you&#8217;ve recently had your transmission fluid changed, is the bolts that connect the pan to your Land Cruiser&#8217;s transmission.&nbsp; If they weren&#8217;t properly torqued, then tightening them would definitely fix the leak.<\/p>\n<p>Also, look at the drain plug bolt (if applicable).&nbsp; Is it loose or stripped?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. Leaking Torque Converter<\/h3>\n<p>As the torque converter spins, it pumps transmission fluid into the main part of the Toyota Land Cruiser&#8217;s transmission.&nbsp; If the torque converter has developed a crack or has internal damage, transmission fluid will leak from it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. Line Issue<\/h3>\n<p>There are lines that connect your transmission to the radiator.&nbsp; They allow the transmission fluid to be cooled off.&nbsp; If these lines get damaged in anyway, your Land Cruiser is going to leak transmission fluid.&nbsp; Finding the leak in the line can be tricky.&nbsp; Look at the lowest point, the ATF will pool and drip from there.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. Bad Seals<\/h3>\n<p>There are many seals inside the transmission that keep the transmission fluid pressurized within it.&nbsp; When these seals go bad, the transmission can&#8217;t hold pressure as well and the transmission fluid will leak.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is last on the list, since you should check all of the external places that a transmission can leak first.&nbsp; When it comes to looking for a bad seal, it&#8217;s something that should be left to a professional.<\/p>\n<h3>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<h2>Driving Your Land Cruiser With a Leaking Transmission<\/h2>\n<p>If your Land Cruiser&#8217;s transmission is leaking a quart of ATF or so every thousand miles, that&#8217;s going to be manageable. &nbsp;But, if you&#8217;re losing a quart every time you take a drive, that&#8217;s going to be a real problem, especially if you let the fluid level get too low.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When the transmission fluid level gets too low the transmission will begin to slip. &nbsp;This means that there is no longer enough fluid in the transmission for it to do its job as a hydraulic fluid that conducts energy from the crank through to the axles\/driveshaft. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s more on <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/transmission-slipping\/\">transmission slipping diagnosis<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Once it begins to slip, your Land Cruiser&#8217;s transmission will begin to wear at an unusually high rate. &nbsp;This is due to the transmission fluid also being a <strong>lubricant<\/strong> and acting as a <strong>coolant<\/strong> as well. &nbsp;Once you take away the lubricant and you let the transmission overheat, it begins to wear at an incredibly fast rate, and will soon not work at all.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion:&nbsp; Land Cruiser Transmission Leak Diagnosis<\/h2>\n<p>If your Toyota Land Cruiser&#8217;s transmission is leaking directly from the transmission pan (far and away the most common area), than it is safe to drive.&nbsp; it should still be fixed right away.<\/p>\n<p>Enough transmission fluid leaking anywhere can be dangerous. &nbsp;But, if you have a few drops showing up on the garage floor, and it only needs topped off now and then, it&#8217;s going to be safe. &nbsp;When in doubt, don&#8217;t drive a vehicle that you don&#8217;t feel comfortable driving, especially if you are smelling a burning smell.<\/p>\n<p>A little leak now will often become a big problem later. &nbsp;Do yourself a favor and have it fixed.&nbsp; If there is anything you would like to add, please leave a comment below.&nbsp; Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;ve found red fluid under your Toyota Land Cruiser, you probably have a transmission leak.
