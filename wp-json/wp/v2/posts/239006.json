Here are the most common causes of P0024:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Oil Issues<\/strong>&#8211; Camshaft Actuators don&#8217;t function properly with old\/no oil. They operate hydraulically and need to use the oil to move up and down. An oil change and a little drive time is often enough to clear P0024.<\/li><li><strong>Wiring Issues<\/strong>&#8211; If the wiring to the camshaft actuator has gone bad it can cause P0024. An old, brittle, or cut wiring harness can mess up the signal coming from the camshaft actuator.  After checking the oil, this is good place to start diagnosing P0024 in the Chevy Corvette. Is the harness connector plugged in? Is there visible damage to any of the wiring? If so, it may be time to replace the harness. How to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.backyardmechanic.org\/how-to-find-a-electrical-short-on-most-any-vehicle\/\">diagnose a short in a vehicle<\/a> (article: <em>Backyard Mechanic).<\/em><\/li><li><strong>Bad Camshaft Actuator<\/strong>&#8211; The camshaft actuator is a solenoid that engages the camshaft and actually controls its timing. They typically aren&#8217;t that expensive. If it&#8217;s not a wiring issue, it&#8217;s a very good chance that this&#8217;ll be the problem.<\/li><li><strong>Timing Chain<\/strong>&#8211; If the timing chain has jumped a tooth (or two), it can leave the engine running advanced, and throw the P0024. Certainly, this is not the most likely cause, but it is certainly possible. <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/timing-chain-jumped-symptoms-and-diagnosis\/\">Timing chain jumped<\/a> (this site).<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Good luck diagnosing P0024 in your Chevy Corvette.
