Spun Bearing<\/h3>\n<p>The bearing that sits between the rod and the crankshaft can spin in place. &nbsp;When this happens it can move out of position and your Spectra will develop knocking rods.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. Rod Cap Stretch<\/h3>\n<p>This rod caps score the rods to the crankshaft. &nbsp;It is not uncommon for them to stretch in harsh conditions. &nbsp;Once this happens the bearing will spin and your Spectra will get a rod knock.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. No Oil<\/h3>\n<p>The fastest way to destroy an engine is to run it with no or low oil. &nbsp;Even a moment without any oil is enough to spin a rod and get a knock. &nbsp;See: &nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Kia-Spectra-leaking-oil\/\">Spectra Oil Leak Diagnosis<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Rod Knock Fix: &nbsp;Kia Spectra<\/h2>\n<p>The only way to fix a rod knock is to replace the rod bearing in question. &nbsp;There&#8217;s almost always much more to it than that. &nbsp;Doing this job properly means a whole engine rebuild is in order. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>At the very least, you&#8217;re going to want to replace all of the rod bearings, piston rings, crank bearings, oil pump (you&#8217;re right there anyway) and get back on the road. &nbsp;A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=Kia+Spectra+engine+rebuild+kit&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=7f4d775d8fe285a4336a4937ca42c893&amp;language=en_US\">good rebuild kit<\/a> is essential. &nbsp;It may very well be that you&#8217;ll need to have to get new rods and a new crank too. &nbsp;It&#8217;s tough to know without taking a look in there first and seeing how much damage was done.<\/p>\n<p>Another option might be to just get a remanufactured engine. &nbsp;They are more than a rebuild kit, but you don&#8217;t have to worry about the quality of the job once you&#8217;re done.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Rod Knock Diagnosis<\/h2>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/4wie5Y_FWL0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Making sure that it&#8217;s actually your Spectra&#8217;s rod that is knocking is critical. &nbsp;Really, there are very few things that sound like it. &nbsp;It should sound so bad that you are afraid to drive the vehicle. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One of the best ways to tell if you have a rod knock is to use a socket extension and push on the piston when it&#8217;s on the downward stroke. &nbsp;It&#8217;s very faint, but you will feel some play if you push down on the bad rod. &nbsp;You will also hear some metal on metal. &nbsp;This method works as long as you have clear access to all of the cylinders. &nbsp;There&#8217;s a great video on how to do this directly above.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_123911\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-123911\" style=\"width: 240px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Rod-Knock-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-123911\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Rod-Knock-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"Kia Spectra Rod Knock Diagnosis\" width=\"250\" height=\"196\"><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-123911\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A good rebuild kit will have everything that you need to get your Spectra&#8217;s engine running good again (assuming it doesn&#8217;t need machine work)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;Spectra Rod Knocking<\/h2>\n<p>The repair cost of a rod knock in your Spectra is going to depend largely on how long the engine has been running like this. &nbsp;You may get away with a simple rebuild, or a new engine may be in order. &nbsp;Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A rod knock is a very serious problem. &nbsp;If your Kia Spectra has a knocking rod, it&#8217;s almost always going to be caused by a failure of the rod bearing or the rod caps (leading to a spun bearing) or lack of oil. &nbsp;
