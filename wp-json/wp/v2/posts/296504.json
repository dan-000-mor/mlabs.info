It can also tell the powertrain control module to cut engine power if needed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hydraulic System<\/strong>&#8211; Can activate one brake at a time.&nbsp; Usually, it piggybacks off of the ABS.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>How It Uses These Components<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The StabiliTrak control unit uses data from its sensors to apply a specific brake or reduce the engine power to correct the slide and get your XT5 pointed back in the right direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if your XT5 is sliding on ice, StabiliTrak can apply one of the rear brakes to help get you pointed in the right direction. Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zlQXqvoFInA\">video from GM<\/a> that shows precisely how the system works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-service-stabilitrak-symptoms-cadillac-xt5\">Service StabiliTrak Symptoms: &nbsp;Cadillac XT5<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Loss of StabiliTrak assistance is not going to be noticed during everyday driving. &nbsp;It only activates when it detects that your XT5 is not moving in the direction you steered or if it detects that a skid has been overcorrected.&nbsp; Most of the time, you&#8217;ll feel it when it engages. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Service StabiliTrak Warning<\/strong>: Your XT5&#8217;s &#8220;Service StabiliTrak&#8221; warning light is the number one indication that something is wrong.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cruise Control<\/strong>:&nbsp; If one of the wheel speed sensors is not working correctly, your XT5 may lose cruise control.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Traction Control Not Working:<\/strong>&nbsp; Your XT5&#8217;s traction control system primarily uses the same sensors to determine if a wheel has broken traction. &nbsp;Unlike StabiliTrak, which controls lateral issues (sliding), traction control keeps the wheels from unnecessary spinning. You may get a &#8220;service traction control&#8221; message and the &#8220;Service StabiliTrak&#8221; warning simultaneously.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-cadillac-xt5-service-stabilitrak-light-causes\">Cadillac XT5:&nbsp; Service StabiliTrak Light Causes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many things can cause the StabiliTrak system to lose its ability to function, but the most common one is a wheel speed sensor. A good scanner should tell you which system has failed and is worth its weight in gold if you&#8217;re trying to fix your XT5&#8217;s StabiliTrak system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wheel Speed Sensor<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Wheel-Speed-Sensor.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"495\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Wheel-Speed-Sensor.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-296375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Wheel-Speed-Sensor.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Wheel-Speed-Sensor-300x149.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Wheel-Speed-Sensor-768x380.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A typical wheel speed sensor<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wheel speed sensors are the number one reason that the StabiliTrak system fails.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If one of the wheel speed sensors is having issues, your XT5 will no longer be able to tell if all wheels are turning at the same speed.&nbsp; Without this data, the &#8220;Service StabiliTrak&#8221; warning will turn on.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wheel speed sensors are exposed to road debris, mud, and salt.&nbsp;&nbsp;This can cause them to fail or their wiring harness to short out. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One telltale sign that the wiring harness to one of the front wheels is failing is the Service Stabilitrak warning when turning your XT5 to the left or right. This is because the harness moves a little while you turn, which can cause the wheel speed sensor to connect and disconnect intermittently. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brake Pedal Switch<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Brake-Pedal-On-Floor.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Brake-Pedal-On-Floor.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-166723\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Brake-Pedal-On-Floor.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Brake-Pedal-On-Floor-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Brake-Pedal-On-Floor-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Your XT5&#8217;s brake pedal switch does more than just control whether or not your brake lights are turned on.&nbsp; The ECU and StabiliTrak control units use this switch to know when you&#8217;re hitting the brakes.&nbsp; If the switch isn&#8217;t functioning correctly, these systems may be disabled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Faulty Stability Control Module<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stability Control Module is your XT5&#8217;s computer that controls the StabiliTrak system. It may have failed or needs to be reset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wrong Tire Size<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Tires.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Tires.jpg\" alt=\"Service Stabilitrak Causes\" class=\"wp-image-277875\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Tires.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Tires-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Tires-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>StabiliTrak may not work correctly if the tire size is not what GM calls for your model XT5.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many other less likely issues can cause the StabiliTrak system to stop working as well. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a good idea to test and see if you have any trouble codes. &nbsp;They may provide you with clues that&#8217;ll help you fix it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Common Questions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to Reset the StabiliTrak System<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>GM recommends that you power down the vehicle for 15 seconds to give the StabiliTrak system time to reboot. &nbsp;If it works after firing your XT5 back up, great! &nbsp;If not, it may be time to have it serviced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><h3>Service Stabilitrak and Check Engine Light<\/h3><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While the StabiliTrak system won&#8217;t cause any engine problems when it has issues, you may get the service engine soon light with the &#8220;Service StabiliTrak&#8221; warning. There could very well be codes stored that can tell you what part of the traction control system has failed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is good news. The stored codes should give you a solid place to start fixing &#8220;Service StabiliTrak&#8221; in your Cadillac XT5. You&#8217;ll need a good code reader that can read codes stored in the body control module.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><h3>Service Stabilitrak and the ABS Light<\/h3><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ABS and StabiliTrak systems use the same wheel speed sensors. Fixing one will more often than not clear the other when you have the service Stabilitrak and ABS light on simultaneously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it may be tempting to ignore the Service StabiliTrak warning, it can be dangerous not having the system available when needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While driving your Cadillac XT5 without traction control or StabiliTrak won&#8217;t cause a breakdown, you are operating your vehicle without an important safety feature.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the most common issues with the Cadillac XT5, or any newer GM vehicle, is the &#8220;Service StabiliTrak&#8221; warning. &nbsp; StabiliTrak is GM&#8217;s electronic stability control system.
