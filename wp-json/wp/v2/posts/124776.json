Low Engine Coolant<\/h3>\n<p>The very first place that you would want to check if your G6 is running hot is going to be the engine coolant. &nbsp;It&#8217;s highly likely that the coolant level is low, and it&#8217;s the easiest thing to check, so start there.<\/p>\n<p>You almost never have to take off the radiator cap to check the coolant level. &nbsp;Modern vehicles use an overflow container. &nbsp;There&#8217;s always coolant in there and it fills up a bit when the engine warms up. &nbsp;It&#8217;ll have a line that says where the coolant should be if it the engine is hot or cold.<\/p>\n<p>If your engine is low on coolant, the overflow container should be empty all of the way, not just a little bit. &nbsp;You&#8217;re going to need the proper Pontiac approved coolant and you&#8217;re going to have to fill it back up.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important that you don&#8217;t pour a bunch of coolant in your G6 while the engine is hot. &nbsp;If it&#8217;s starving for coolant, the dramatic temperature change can cause engine damage. &nbsp;It&#8217;s best to fill the overflow, let the engine cycle it through for a few minutes and start over again. &nbsp;This should be done with the engine cool.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. Radiator Fan<\/h3>\n<p>Depending on the model year and the engine, your G6 could have a clutch fan or an electric fan. &nbsp;A bad fan can cause your engine to run hot. &nbsp;The fan pushes air over the radiator to keep it running cool. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When you are out on the highway, the wind passing over the radiator is more than enough to keep it cool. &nbsp;You will notice that a fan is not working properly when the vehicle isn&#8217;t moving very fast. &nbsp;If the engine begins to cool off when you get onto the highway and into &#8220;clean&#8221; air, it very well could be the fan.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to tell if the radiator fan is bad or not. &nbsp;When your engine is running warm, that fan should be on. &nbsp;With the vehicle in park, go ahead and pop the hood. &nbsp;The fan should be moving. &nbsp;If it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s almost certain that you need a new fan. &nbsp;It can also be the thermostat that tells the fan when to come on or off that could be at fault. &nbsp;It&#8217;s much more likely to be the fan though.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. Radiator Issues<\/h3>\n<p>Your G6&#8217;s water pump pushes coolant through the engine. &nbsp;The coolant exits the engine and enters the radiator. &nbsp;Simply put, the radiator is a series of finned tubes that cool the coolant so that it can return to the engine and pull more heat from it.<\/p>\n<p>The radiator can fail in a few ways. &nbsp;It can become so grimmy with deposits that it can no longer cool the engine all of the way. &nbsp;This is a likely scenario when your engine is running hot&nbsp;<strong>but not overheating<\/strong>. &nbsp;As time goes by, the radiator will only get worse until it can no longer cool the engine.<\/p>\n<p>In this situation, you&#8217;ll need to take your radiator to a shop to have it repaired. &nbsp;Or, you can order a new one. &nbsp;Some people have success using a cure in a bottle cleaner.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><iframe style=\"width: 120px; height: 240px;\" src=\"\/\/ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com\/widgets\/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ss&amp;ref=as_ss_li_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=700r4hq-20&amp;language=en_US&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=B00R74I5UY&amp;asins=B00R74I5UY&amp;linkId=b34feecc1185e72f0762045b3140809a&amp;show_border=true&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=true\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. Thermostat<\/h3>\n<p>Your G6&#8217;s thermostat is the gatekeeper that keeps the coolant from entering and exiting the engine. &nbsp;While a thermostat is perfectly capable of functioning for the whole life of the vehicle, it&#8217;s still a common reason that you can be running hot.<\/p>\n<p>After the engine temperature reaches a certain level, the thermostat automatically opens up. &nbsp;This regulates the amount of coolant flowing through the engine. &nbsp;If the thermostat wasn&#8217;t there, the engine would always run cool. &nbsp;Heat is needed for efficient combustion, and for the heater to work properly.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s more on Pontiac G6 <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Pontiac-G6-bad-thermostat-symptoms\/\">thermostat diagnosis<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>5. Water Pump<\/h3>\n<p>The water pump is the engine accessory that pumps the coolant through the G6&#8217;s engine. &nbsp;If it has a bearing fail on it, or when it is no longer being turned properly (bad serpentine belt), it won&#8217;t be able to pump enough coolant through your G6 and the engine will begin to run hot.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>6. Debris<\/h3>\n<p>A common thing that can happen when driving on the interstate is picking up trash that blocks the radiator. &nbsp;Take a look around the front of your G6 and see if there is anything around it. &nbsp;You&#8217;re looking for a grocery bag, cardboard, or something large that would be blocking a decent chunk of the radiator.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;G6 Running Hot<\/h2>\n<p>An engine that is running hot is a big deal. &nbsp;Good luck diagnosing your Pontiac G6. &nbsp;If there is anything that you would like to add, please leave a comment below.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If your Pontiac G6 is running hot, it is a serious problem. &nbsp;If it gets too hot, it leads to overheating. &nbsp;A hot engine is usually caused by a few different things, such as the thermostat, water pump, radiator, or outside conditions. &nbsp; &nbsp; Pontiac G6 Running Hot Symptoms Obviously, the main symptom of running &#8230; <a title=\"Pontiac G6:  Running Hot \u2192 Causes\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/pontiac-g6-running-hot\/\" aria-label=\"More on Pontiac G6:  Running Hot \u2192 Causes\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[168],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/124776"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=124776"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/124776\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=124776"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=124776"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=124776"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
