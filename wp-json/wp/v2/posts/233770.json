The first part is the malfunctioning part on your Corolla, the second part indicates what is wrong, and the third part tells you where the malfunctioning HO2S is located.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HO2S <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The heated oxygen sensor measures the exhaust after it exits the combustion chamber.  The PCM uses this data to maintain the proper 14.7:1 air\/fuel ratio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Heater Control Circuit High<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The heated element within the oxygen sensor heats the sensor faster than the exhaust can on its own.  This reduces emissions by letting the fuel trim enter closed loop operation more quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Corolla&#8217;s PCM has detected that the heater control circuit resistance is outside the manufacturer&#8217;s specified range.  When this happens, P0032 is stored in the onboard memory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bank 1 Sensor 1<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/O2-Sensor.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/O2-Sensor.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-188616\" width=\"464\" height=\"231\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/O2-Sensor.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/O2-Sensor-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/O2-Sensor-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px\" \/><\/a><figcaption>Hopefully, your O2 sensor is this easy to get to.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>B1S1 is the location of the oxygen sensor.

Check the Wiring on Bank 1 Sensor 1<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CHECK THE WIRING HARNESS FOR DAMAGE since P0032 indicates a fault in the heated O2 sensor circuit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pay extra close attention to where the harness may have rubbed up against something or has been damaged by road debris.  Look for burnt, frail, or damaged wiring.  Wiring issues are a VERY COMMON cause for P0032.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at where your Corolla&#8217;s oxygen sensor plugs into the wiring harness and see if there has been any damage to the pins or if the wiring harness is breaking at the pigtail. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the pins appear corroded, get some electrical contact cleaner and clean them up.  If they are damaged, you will need to repin or replace your wiring harness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2a-verify-the-o2-sensor-is-bad-swap-test\">2a. Verify the O2 Sensor is Bad- Swap Test<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-base-background-color has-background\"><em>This method does not work if Toyota Corolla has P0052 AND P0032.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Corolla happens to be a V6 or V8 model, you can do the &#8220;swap test.&#8221; This test involves clearing the codes and seeing if the code &#8220;jumps&#8221; to bank 2.  It&#8217;s a great test because it&#8217;s foolproof and easy to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how the swap test is done:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Clear the DTC codes with your scanner.<\/li><li>Swap the Bank 2 Sensor 1 O2 sensor with the Bank 1 Sensor 1.  It\u2019ll be on or right after the exhaust manifold.<\/li><li>Run your Corolla&#8217;s engine until the check engine light comes back on. <\/li><li>If the code changes to P0052 (The Bank 2 version of this code), that\u2019s proof enough you need to replace the oxygen sensor you swapped.<\/li><li>If the code remains P0032, you\u2019ll need to continue pursuing your diagnosis, knowing that both O2 sensors are working fine.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2b-check-the-fuses-and-voltage\">2b. Check the O2 Sensor Heater Resistance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the heater element resistance.  This will for sure verify whether the heated element is bad or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is voltage at the heater circuit, you&#8217;ll need to test the ground for resistance.  If you find infinite resistance, you&#8217;ll need to repair the ground circuit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How to Test Resistance of O2 Sensor Heater\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YzkBdPP8l2g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-bad-oxygen-sensor\">3.
