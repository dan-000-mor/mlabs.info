The 4L80E is it&#8217;s direct descendant. \u00a0Stock 4L80E&#8217;s benefit from 40+ extra years of research and development. \u00a0They also benefit from not being so old. \u00a0There are very few clean Th400 transmissions that have never been rebuilt. \u00a0Whereas there are great 4L80E&#8217;s are readily available at the local wrecking yard or on Craigslist.<\/p>\n<p>All things being equal the 4L80E is a much better transmission for most applications. \u00a0 It&#8217;s the better choice by virtue of the overdrive gear alone. \u00a0There are a few hiccups to putting a 4L80E behind a classic small-block Chevy. \u00a0It is totally doable.<br \/>\nThere are a few things that you really need to understand if you are to swap one for the other.<\/p>\n<p>The two main differences between these transmissions is the <strong>number of gears<\/strong> that they have and the way that they are <strong>controlled<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">4L80E vs TH400 Gearing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The 4L80E has an overdrive gear with a ratio of 0.75:1. \u00a0It&#8217;s not as aggressive as the 4L60E though, which has a final gear ratio of .70:1. \u00a0The 4L80E keeps doesn&#8217;t drop the engine rpm as much between shifts because it is a heavy duty transmission and assumes that you could very well be pulling a load. \u00a0If you drop the engine rpm to hard it can take it right out of the power band.<\/p>\n<p>While the TH400 lacks the overdrive gear of the 4L80E, <strong>every other gear is the same<\/strong>. \u00a0Here are both

in the Way TH400 VS. a 4L80E are Controlled<\/h2>\n<p>The way that these transmissions are controlled is totally different. \u00a0And by that I don&#8217;t mean how you put them into gear. \u00a0I mean how does the transmission know when it&#8217;s time to shift. \u00a0The TH400 uses a kick down cable to downshift, whereas the 4L80E uses a computer controlled shift table. \u00a0 This presents a problem to people who want to put a 4L80E into a car or truck that doesn&#8217;t have a computer controlled engine. \u00a0The easiest solution is to use a transmission controller to control the shifting for you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Physical Differences<\/h2>\n<p>Both the 4L80E and TH400 are really big transmissions. \u00a0The 4L80E is huge. \u00a0Anyone considering swapping one into a car that it wasn&#8217;t originally equipped in should definitely check around the forums and see if anyone has tried the swap yet. \u00a0You&#8217;ll be surprised how many people end up having to beat on their firewall or modify their tunnel in order to fit this beast in their vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>They are also different lengths. \u00a0The 4L80E is significantly longer. \u00a0It also weighs more than the TH400 as well. \u00a0The weight on the TH400 is around 130 pounds, whereas the 4L80E is significantly heavier. \u00a0It weighs 187 pounds. \u00a0That may not sound like a lot, but when you are on your back trying to manipulate one of them on a transmission jack, there&#8217;s quite the difference.<\/p>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">T<\/span>orque Converter Engagement Depth<\/h2>\n<p>You need <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2BBFgWi\">an adapter<\/a> to get a TH400 to bolt up to an LS motor properly. \u00a0The standard GM bellhousing bolt pattern is used on each transmission, so it&#8217;s no problem to bolt them up with the adapter. \u00a0If you go 4L80E to an old SBC, you&#8217;ll need a <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2Gv8hpZ\">transmission controller<\/a>. \u00a0These are not cheap. \u00a0But, there&#8217;s otherwise no way for the 4L80E to know what the engine is doing and when it can shift.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>No matter which transmission you decide to go with, deciding between the TH400 versus a 4L80E is mainly going to come down to what kind of engine you are currently running. \u00a0If you want an overdrive solution for an older GM vehicle, I would suggest getting a built <a href=\"\/\">700R4.<\/a>\u00a0 It&#8217;ll be way less hassle and provide the same overdrive, without nearly as much hassle.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>See Also:<\/p>\n<p><a
