Usually accompanied by a squeal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A slipping serpentine belt is the most common cause of a burning rubber smell coming from your Jeep Gladiator. It&#8217;s either slipping, or something is rubbing against it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your truck&#8217;s serpentine belt turns the water pump, alternator, power steering pump, and A\/C compressor. &nbsp;If one of these starts locking up, the pulley won&#8217;t turn, and the belt will burn up. It&#8217;s usually not long before the damage is so significant that the belt breaks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fix<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Look under your Gladiator&#8217;s hood with the engine off (avoid the electric fan even with the key off). Inspect the serpentine belt to verify that nothing is rubbing against it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is the belt shiny and cracked? This would indicate that the belt is slipping. Replacing it involves loosening the tensioner and putting a new one on. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, the most challenging part of this process is rerouting the belt. First, take a picture of the route if there isn&#8217;t a schematic under the hood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something in your engine bay may be rubbing the serpentine belt. &nbsp;This often happens when one of your engine accessories begins to lock up. &nbsp;You should hear a <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/jeep-gladiator-bad-serpentine-belt\/\">squeal from the serpentine belt<\/a> as this is happening. It&#8217;ll smell heavily of burnt rubber.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Jeep Gladiator&#8217;s A\/C compressor may have its own belt. Look at the balancer and ensure there isn&#8217;t a second belt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Melting Hoses\">Melting Hoses<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Radiator-Hose.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Radiator-Hose.jpg\" alt=\"Jeep Gladiator Melting Hose Burnt Smell\n\" class=\"wp-image-296452\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Radiator-Hose.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Radiator-Hose-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Radiator-Hose-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-base-2-background-color has-background\">Smell Type: <strong>Burning rubber or a sweet smell<\/strong>.

It&#8217;s almost always caused by oil leaking from the valve covers onto the exhaust manifold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fix<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Look under the hood with the engine cold and off. You should be able to see evidence that oil is leaking. &nbsp;If you find oil leaking from the valve cover, you&#8217;ll either need to replace the valve cover gasket or re-torque the bolts. &nbsp;They can loosen after years of vibration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When this is the case, you should always smell the burning smell, and it should be strongest coming from the truck&#8217;s engine bay.

The smell comes from the tailpipe. There should be blue or black smoke.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another prevalent reason for a burning smell is burning oil. So if your Gladiator is burning oil, you should be able to smell it the most from the tailpipe. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should also be accompanied by <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Jeep-gladiator-blue-exhaust-smoke\/\">blue smoke<\/a>, and the oil level should also go down.

Refrigerant has more than one function. Besides the obvious, it also lubricates the compressor. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the refrigerant level gets too low, the compressor will begin to burn up, and you&#8217;ll have a burning smell that is often described as burning oil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fix<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the compressor isn&#8217;t too far gone, repairing the leak and recharging the system will fix the problem. Your Jeep Gladiator may require a new AC compressor to stop the burning smell, though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fixing a bad A\/C compressor in a truck can be a big job, but it can be done with the proper knowledge and tools. The first step is identifying the exact problem and determining if the compressor is faulty or needs to be adjusted.

The burnt smell coming from your Gladiator&#8217;s engine, plus a high reading from the thermostat, is enough evidence to investigate the cooling system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspect the engine bay and look for any obvious signs of malfunction. Check the radiator overflow to confirm there&#8217;s still coolant in the system. Also, check for any fan belts that may have slipped or shredded, as well as any clogged hoses that could prevent coolant from circulating properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the radiator to ensure it hasn&#8217;t sprung a leak, as this is one of the most common causes of an overheating engine. Also, look closely at the hoses leading from and to the radiator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A thermostat that&#8217;s stuck closed can also cause your Gladiator&#8217;s engine to overheat, as it won&#8217;t let coolant into the engine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Road Debris\">Road Debris<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Bad-Smell-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"958\" height=\"572\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Bad-Smell-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"Jeep Gladiator Bad Smell Diagnosis\" class=\"wp-image-117139\"\/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-base-2-background-color has-background\">Smell Type: <strong>Burning Rubber or Burning Plastic<\/strong>.
