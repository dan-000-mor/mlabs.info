This limited power is a failsafe to keep the vehicle able to move, but not super fast. Since the ECM won&#8217;t really know how much throttle response is actually happening when you push the gas.<\/li>\n<li>The vehicle&#8217;s ECM will control the amount of fuel entering the engine in order to control engine speed.<\/li>\n<li>The Camry may idle differently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Failsafe mode leaves a vehicle in a state that makes it almost impossible to drive and enjoy.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>P0121 Causes- Camry<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0121-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4144 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0121-Diagnosis-300x74.png\" alt=\"P0121 Diagnosis Toyota Camry\" width=\"300\" height=\"74\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0121-Diagnosis-300x74.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0121-Diagnosis-100x25.png 100w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0121-Diagnosis-150x37.png 150w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0121-Diagnosis-200x50.png 200w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0121-Diagnosis-450x112.png 450w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0121-Diagnosis.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the Toyota Camry, the P0121 is going to be caused by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A discrepancy between the voltage reading from TPS sensor circuit &#8220;A&#8221; and TPS circuit &#8220;B&#8221; where TPS circuit &#8220;A&#8221; is higher than the specified voltage range by more than 1.6 volts.<\/li>\n<li>A discrepancy between the voltage reading from TPS sensor circuit &#8220;A&#8221; and TPS circuit &#8220;B&#8221; where TPS circuit &#8220;A&#8221; is lower than the specified voltage range by more than 0.8 volts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In normal English, the two TPS circuits can&#8217;t agree on how far the gas pedal has been pushed down.

They&#8217;ll then see if the problem comes back.<\/p>\n<p>The mechanic will also compare the data from TPS circuit &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;B&#8221; to see where the discrepancy is. After that they&#8217;ll typically inspect the TPS wiring to make sure that it is not loose or damaged.<\/p>\n<p>If it all checks out and the code comes back, they may go ahead and replace the TPS sensor in question. Most of the time, the problem when P0121 is thrown will be the TPS sensor itself. It no longer is accurately tracking how hard the fuel pedal is being pushed.<\/p>\n<p>Diagnosing the issue with a scanner or having a mechanic take a look can save the expense of buying a TPS sensor that your Camry does not actually need.<\/p>\n<p>Good luck diagnosing P0121 in your Toyota Camry.
