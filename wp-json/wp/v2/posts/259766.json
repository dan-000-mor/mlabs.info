But, if it&#8217;s stuck closed, there&#8217;s a danger you can overheat the engine when driving the vehicle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Your Juke&#8217;s Active Grille Shutter System Works<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The active grille shutter system is designed to reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency.  It does this by blocking the grille opening at high speeds.  It will open if the coolant or oil temperatures pass a certain threshold (usually 203\u00b0F for the coolant).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Start-Up Diagnosis<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Each time you drive a Nissan Juke equipped with the active grille shutter system, it runs a self-diagnostic to verify that it can open and close properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The grille shutter always opens when the ignition is turned off.  The next time the vehicle is turned on, the powertrain control module will command it to close.  It then immediately opens back up and the self-diagnostic is complete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it fails this self-diagnostic test, O059F will be stored in your Juke&#8217;s internal memory, and the check engine light will come on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nissan Juke P059F Symptoms<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether or not the active grille shutter system is opened or closed will change what symptoms you should expect to experience with P059F.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Nissan-Juke-overheating-symptoms-causes\/\">Overheating<\/a> (shutter stuck closed)<\/li><li>Decreased Fuel Economy (shutter stuck open)<\/li><li>Check engine light<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The loss in fuel economy will be marginal at best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nissan Juke P059F Causes + Diagnosis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"P059F Diagnosis\" class=\"wp-image-190153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a solid diagnostic order for diagnosing P059F in the Nissan Juke, as well as the most common causes for this code:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Debris<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing you should do if you have P059F is check the grille for debris.  It is very common to pick something up on the road that&#8217;ll wedge in there that&#8217;ll keep the grille from opening or closing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the wintertime, snow can get into the grille and turn to ice.  If you happen to be reading this when it hasn&#8217;t been above freezing out for a while, an iced grille is a real possibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snow, trash, and even leaves are enough to bind the shutter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Check For Technical Service Bulletins<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, if there doesn&#8217;t appear to be anything binding the grille shutter, it&#8217;s time to start diagnosing the active grille shutter system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With P059F, check to see if there is a Technical Service Bulletin relating to this problem for your Tacom&#8217;s model year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TSB&#8217;s are notices that manufacturers provide that detail common problems and common solutions with vehicles they make.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are quite a few sites for looking them up online.  Otherwise, you can call your dealer and ask them to look it up for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shutter Harness Wiring Problem<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The wiring harness going to the active grille shutter control actuator could be opened or shorted.  Due to its location at the front and bottom of your Juke, it can take damage more than a typical wiring harness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for burnt, frayed, broken, or otherwise damaged wiring.  Make sure the connector pins are corrosion-free. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bad Active Grille Air Shutter Actuator <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the wiring harness checks out, and the grille is debris-free, it&#8217;s time to suspect the actuator.  The active grille shutter actuator is what physically opens and closes the grille.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a good scan tool, you can command it to open and close.  If it fails to do so, it likely needs replaced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few reasons that P059F can occur in the Nissan Juke.  You should always start by inspecting the grille.
