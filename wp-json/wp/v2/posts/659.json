They were popular in the Muscle Car era. As a rule of thumb, they were not built to handle the kind of power that a Muncie transmission could handle. So, if you are looking to drop one in a vehicle that makes more power than it did when it was stock, you should consider going a different way. That being said, you didn&#8217;t come here for my opinion about what to do with a transmission you could be very well looking at right now. Lets get straight to it!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Saginaw vs. Muncie identification<\/h3>\n<p>Far and away the easiest way of telling them apart is what the transmission is made of. \u00a0The Saginaw was made out of iron. \u00a0It usually found its way into trucks and other heavy vehicles where weight was not at a premium. \u00a0<strong>The Muncie was made out of Aluminum.<\/strong> \u00a0So and old Muncie will usually be smooth and a little greasy. \u00a0An older Saginaw will usually be coated in rust unless it was cared for extra ordinarily well. \u00a0There is quite a difference between them side by side. \u00a0Have a look:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Muncie-vs.-Saginaw.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-662\" src=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Muncie-vs.-Saginaw-1024x768.png\" alt=\"Saginaw Transmission Identification\" width=\"605\" height=\"454\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Muncie-vs.-Saginaw.png 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Muncie-vs.-Saginaw-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Muncie-vs.-Saginaw-768x576.png 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Muncie-vs.-Saginaw-100x75.png 100w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Muncie-vs.-Saginaw-150x113.png 150w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Muncie-vs.-Saginaw-200x150.png 200w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Muncie-vs.-Saginaw-450x338.png 450w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Muncie-vs.-Saginaw-600x450.png 600w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Muncie-vs.-Saginaw-900x675.png 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>A lot of people just need to know which one is which, and the case material will provide you with fine answer to that question.<\/p>\n<p>Another way to tell the identify a Saginaw transmission is to <strong>look at the shift arms<\/strong>. \u00a0On the Muncie they are on the tail shaft, whereas with the Saginaw they are on the side of the case. \u00a0Observe the picture above. \u00a0You can see the shift arms right on the side of the case.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Saginaw four speed transmission identification\u00a0codes<\/h3>\n<p>Also, one of the most common issues you may experience when looking at a Saginaw is whether or not you are even looking at a three speed or four speed version of the transmission. \u00a0If there happens to be a shifter on top of it you can manually count the number of gears (which is never a bad idea). \u00a0That&#8217;s a safe way to verify it if the casting numbers are difficult to read.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll find the casting numbers on the main transmission case just after the tail shaft housing. \u00a0The first letter in this number is going to tell you exactly which Saginaw transmission you have. \u00a0You are looking of the letter R. \u00a0<strong>If the first letter of the code starts with an R than you can be confident that you have found what you can be confident that it is a four speed version<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>If it starts with an M you are looking at a Muncie, and if starts with an S you are looking at the 3 speed Saginaw. \u00a0If you would like to read more about decoding a 1960&#8217;s transmission, <a href=\"http:\/\/talk.classicparts.com\/threads\/need-help-to-decode-saginaw-4-speed-transmission.18169\/\">this page is pretty good<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Saginaw 4 speed identification-\u00a0figuring out the gearing<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a big restoration guy.
