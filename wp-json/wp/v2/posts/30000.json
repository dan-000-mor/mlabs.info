Other symptoms may include poor engine performance and a decrease in fuel economy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lack of heat<\/strong>&#8211; The most prominent symptom of the P0128 trouble code in the Mercury Villager is the lack of heat. When the thermostat doesn&#8217;t bring the engine up to the proper operating temp, it means that the coolant going through the heater core isn&#8217;t as hot. This leads to less\/no heat. If you feel your van&#8217;s heater working better when sitting still and worse on the highway, that&#8217;s a dead giveaway for a thermostat that is stuck open.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Service Engine Soon<\/strong>&#8211; Other than the heater not working, the only other symptom of P0128 is typically the service engine soon light itself.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Slight Decrease in fuel economy<\/strong>&#8211; The P0128 code may also lead to a slight decrease in fuel economy. This is because your Villager&#8217;s engine is running at a cooler temperature than it should be. As a result, it consumes more gasoline to keep itself running correctly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>P0128 Causes: Mercury Villager<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fixing P0128 in the Mercury Villager is usually a pretty easy thing to do since, 90% of the time, a stuck thermostat will cause the problem. Here are the most common causes of P0128:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Thermostat-Car.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Thermostat-Car.jpg\" alt=\"P0128 Causes Mercury Villager\" class=\"wp-image-178732\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Thermostat-Car.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Thermostat-Car-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thermostat Stuck Open<\/strong>&#8211; Far and away, the most typical cause for the P0128 code is a thermostat that is stuck open. When a thermostat is stuck open, it allows coolant to flow through the engine at all times. When this happens, the engine is &#8220;over-cooled&#8221; and never reaches the proper operating temperature. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NehZEoOZrn4\">How to Replace a Thermostat (video)<\/a>. &nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>ECT Sensor<\/strong>\/<strong>Wiring-<\/strong> If the thermostat itself isn&#8217;t the problem, it&#8217;ll be the wiring\/sensor associated with Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor (ECT).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mercury Villager P0128 Diagnosis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How To Diagnose A P0128 - A Faulty Thermostat\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Qxpvv9WlH2s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>An excellent way to tell if it&#8217;s a sensor issue or an issue with the thermostat is whether or not the Mercury Villager&#8217;s engine is running at its proper operating temperature. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be challenging to tell this in a vehicle that doesn&#8217;t have a temperature gauge. <strong>If you feel the heater isn&#8217;t working well, that is the easiest way to tell the thermostat is stuck open<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are there Other Codes?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are codes related to the ECT, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0117-mercury-villager\/\" title=\"\">P0117<\/a> or P0118, they indicate that the Engine Coolant Temp Sensor is not performing correctly, which means you should start diagnosing P0128 in your Mercury Villager by taking a look at the ECT and wiring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is the Heat Blowing Hot?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An excellent way to at least get a good idea of whether it&#8217;s the thermostat or the sensor is to start the van cold and let it idle for ten minutes. If you feel little to no heat from the heater, it&#8217;s a good indication that the thermostat is the problem and not a wiring issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Squeeze the Thermostat Hose<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A mechanic will check under the hood where your Villager&#8217;s radiator hose meets the thermostat housing. If it is easy to pinch the hose, the engine coolant will typically flow through it. <span style=\"color: #993300;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-base-2-background-color has-background\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>If you pinch your hose, stay aware of the belted accessories and the fan. The fan can come on at any time<span style=\"color: #000000;\">.<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Check the Coolant Temperature<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a further step, the mechanic may check the coolant temperature at the thermostat housing to see if it\u2019s responding correctly. If it isn&#8217;t, there&#8217;s likely an issue with the thermostat itself. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll need an infrared temperature gun to verify the temperature at the thermostat. They&#8217;re not very expensive at places such as Harbor Freight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Inspect All Electrical Connections<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The mechanic will also inspect all electrical connections to ensure they are in good condition and not corroded or loose. If they are, repair the harness and verify that it clears the code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Replace the Thermostat<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If all of the above checks out and it still seems like the thermostat is the culprit, then it&#8217;s time to replace it. Replacing the thermostat in the Mercury Villager is relatively easy and should take no more than an hour or two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After repairing your Villager, clear the code from your van&#8217;s computer and reset it. Then, take a test drive and verify that it hasn&#8217;t returned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>P0128 is not a severe threat to the immediate drivability of your Villager. However, it should be noted that most modern fuel-injected engines like to run at 200+ degrees. Letting them run too cool can cause problems after an extended period.
