Here are both parts of its definition for the Toyota Tundra:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vehicle Speed Sensor<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The VSS has two main functions.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The first is to provide data to the speedometer.  It&#8217;s not uncommon for the speedometer to be erratic or unmoving when a vehicle has P0501. <\/li><li>The second function of the VSS is to provide speed data to the PCM.  The PCM needs to know how fast your Tundra is moving to support many vital functions.  The traction control system, cruise control, ABS, and even transmission shift points all need VSS data to work.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The VSS can be located on the transmission tail shaft, around the wheel hub, or (on older models) be integrated with a mechanical speedometer.  Where it&#8217;ll be located on your vehicle will depend on the make, model year, and transmission type.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Range\/Performance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The signal coming from the VSS is not within its normal operating range.  The voltage could be erratic, too high, or too low.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Toyota Tundra: P0501 Symptoms<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the most common symptoms of P0501:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Check engine light<\/li><li>Limp mode<\/li><li>Erratic shifting (likely shifting too early)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Toyota-Tundra-abs-light\/\">ABS light<\/a><\/li><li>Traction control light<\/li><li>Speedometer not working properly<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If the ABS and traction control lights are on, and P0501 is the only code stored in your PCM&#8217;s memory, fixing the code&#8217;s cause should turn them off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Toyota Tundra: P0501 Causes and Diagnosis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"P0501 Causes and Fix\" class=\"wp-image-190153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the most common causes of P0501 in the Toyota Tundra and a good order to check them in.  The exact repair steps will depend on the transmission and model year of your vehicle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1.  Check For Other Codes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing you should do is document all trouble codes and data before touching anything.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s likely another code may shed more light on what&#8217;s going on.  If the VSS voltage is too low, you may also get P0502.  If it is too high, you&#8217;re likely to see P0503.  That&#8217;s a good starting point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.  Inspect the VSS Wiring<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, locate your Tundra&#8217;s VSS and inspect the wiring harness going to it.  You are looking for broken, or frayed wiring.  Wiring issues are a very common cause of P0501.  If any wiring looks bad, repair it and clear the code.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3.  Check the Sensor Voltage<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the voltage at the VSS sensor.  If it is within factory specs, it&#8217;s likely that the VSS sensor has gone bad and needs to be replaced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news with P0501 in the Toyota Tundra is that there aren&#8217;t many common causes. <strong> Replacing the VSS is far and away the most common fix<\/strong>.
