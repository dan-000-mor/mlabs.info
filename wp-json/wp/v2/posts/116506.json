Gauge\/Temp Light<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Overheating-Symptoms.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-116355\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Overheating-Symptoms.png\" alt=\"GMC Sierra Overheating Symptoms\" width=\"133\" height=\"144\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Your Sierra will be equipped with a temperature warning light and\/or a temperature gauge.&nbsp; The most common symptom of overheating is the temperature light coming on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If this light does come on, make sure that you get off the road quickly and safely.&nbsp; Driving while overheating can cause long term engine damage.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. White Smoke<\/h3>\n<p>If your Sierra&#8217;s engine gets hot enough, the coolant will begin to boil over and manifest itself as steam coming up from under the hood.&nbsp; It does this to relieve the pressure on the cooling system before lasting damage can be done to it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. Blown Head Gasket<\/h3>\n<p>If your Sierra is run for too long of a period while overheating, the head gasket may blow.&nbsp; <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/GMC-Sierra-blown-head-gasket\/\">Bad head gasket symptoms<\/a> include white smoke coming from the tail pipe, rough idle, and oil in the coolant.&nbsp; Shutting down before it overheats, or as soon as you see that it is overheating will usually prevent this from happening.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Overheating Causes: GMC Sierra<\/h2>\n<p>The first thing that you need to do is check your Sierra&#8217;s overflow container.&nbsp; If it is full, you can rule out low coolant or a coolant leak, and skip the next section.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Low Coolant<\/h3>\n<p>Low coolant is the most common reason that your Sierra will overheat.&nbsp; Low coolant is a symptom of a cooling system leak of some kind.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t just randomly disappear.&nbsp; Here are some of the reasons that your coolant may run low:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Radiator damage<\/li>\n<li>Cracked\/bad radiator hose<\/li>\n<li>Bad radiator cap<\/li>\n<li>Thermostat housing damage<\/li>\n<li>Water pump gasket<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are a lot of places to look for a radiator leak.&nbsp; Make sure that you don&#8217;t take the radiator cap off when the engine is warm.&nbsp; In fact, you really should not need to take it off at all, unless the coolant is leaking from the cap itself.<\/p>\n<p>A slow leak can be more difficult to find than a quick leak, since the coolant can evaporate before it has a chance to show itself.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you are loosing fluid, but can&#8217;t readily see the leak, <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2OmrHCy\">UV dye<\/a> is a great tool to locate it.&nbsp; It really does work well.&nbsp; If you aren&#8217;t finding anything even with the dye, take a look at the rear exhaust.&nbsp; Do you have a lot of <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/white-smoke-from-exhaust-GMC-Sierra\/\">white smoke<\/a>?&nbsp; That&#8217;s a very good indication that you have a blown head gasket.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Bad Radiator Fan<\/h3>\n<p>While going down the road the movement of air through your Sierra&#8217;s radiator will usually be enough to keep it cool, without the help of the fan.&nbsp; It&#8217;s when you are hardly moving that the radiator fan is going to do the work of keeping air flowing into the radiator.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a temperature gauge, you&#8217;ll notice that the temp will usually cool down when you get onto the highway and get moving into clean air.&nbsp; When the cooling system itself is bad, usually the opposite will happen.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Bad Thermostat<\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_112473\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-112473\" style=\"width: 190px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Bad-Thermostat-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-112473\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Bad-Thermostat-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"GMC Sierra Overheating Causes\" width=\"200\" height=\"217\"><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-112473\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A typical thermostat<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>One of the most common reasons that a vehicle overheats is a <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/GMC-Sierra-bad-thermostat-symptoms\/\">bad thermostat<\/a>.&nbsp; If your radiator overflow is full (and you radiator fan is kicking on), it is very likely that a bad thermostat or bad water pump are causing your Sierra to overheat.&nbsp; Of these two, the thermostat fails more often than the water pump.&nbsp; It&#8217;s also much more affordable and easier to get to.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Bad Water Pump<\/h3>\n<p>The water pump is driven by the serpentine belt attached to the Sierra&#8217;s engine.&nbsp; Has your belt been squeaking when you start up, or when you are on the road?&nbsp; That can be an indication of a <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/GMC-Sierra-bad-serpentine-belt\/\">bad serpentine belt<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When your water pump does go bad, it will often leak water.&nbsp; Or it&#8217;ll make a grating noise.&nbsp; This is due to the bearings inside of it going bad.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/RtLhHw1wMPM\">great video<\/a> on how to tell if your water pump is bad.<\/p>\n<p>A good trick to tell if the water pump may be bad is to put it into neutral and rev the engine up a few thousand RPM for a few seconds.&nbsp; If the temperature went down, that can indicate a bad water pump.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; A dying pump may get spinning enough to move the coolant with the increase in RPM.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion:&nbsp; Sierra Overheating Symptoms &amp; Causes<\/h2>\n<p>There can be a lot of different reasons that your GMC Sierra&#8217;s engine would overheat.&nbsp; We hope this helps you find out why.&nbsp; If there is anything that you would like to add, please leave a comment below.&nbsp;
