Noises<\/h3>\n<p>Your ears are the best diagnostic tool that you have. &nbsp;You can tell a lot about what&#8217;s going on with a vehicle by carefully listening for changes. &nbsp;A bad starter will often click, but not engage the flywheel\/flexplate. &nbsp;It can also make a grinding sound.<\/p>\n<p>If you hear a high pitched whirring sound, it may indicate that your Bravada&#8217;s starter is bad, or it could mean that the starter is turning, but not making contact with the flywheel. &nbsp;This is often caused by starter bolts that were not torqued tightly enough, or a broken flex plate\/flywheel tooth.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. Won&#8217;t Start<\/h3>\n<p>If your Bravada won&#8217;t start that can be a very strong indication of a bad starter. &nbsp;The thing is, it can also indicate other problems as well. &nbsp;You don&#8217;t want to go through all of the trouble involved in replacing your starter only to discover that it wasn&#8217;t bad at all.<\/p>\n<p>Common other reasons your Bravada won&#8217;t start include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Bad Battery Cables or Terminals<\/strong><\/span>&#8211; Throughout your Bravada&#8217;s life, the battery cables and terminals can become corroded. &nbsp;This corrosion keeps the proper voltage from getting to the starter. &nbsp;If the dash lights dim or turn off entirely when trying to start your Bravada, that can indicate the battery or cables.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>Bad Battery<\/strong><\/span>&#8211; A battery that is too depleted won&#8217;t start your engine. &nbsp;If the starter is turning slowly, but not fast enough for your Bravada to start, it could very likely be a bad battery that is at fault (as opposed to a bad starter).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t sure if it&#8217;s the starter or not, here&#8217;s a whole article on diagnosing why your <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Oldsmobile-Bravada-wont-start\/\">Bravada won&#8217;t start<\/a>. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. &nbsp;Smoke<\/h3>\n<p>Smoke coming from under the hood is a good indication that the starter has given up the ghost. &nbsp;It can burn up, or the wiring associated with it can burn up. &nbsp;If you see smoke, stop cranking! &nbsp;Make sure your Bravada isn&#8217;t on fire and have a mechanic take a look.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Bad Starter Diagnosis: &nbsp;Oldsmobile Bravada<\/h2>\n<p>You&#8217;ll want to take a look at your Bravada&#8217;s battery cables and battery posts. &nbsp;If they are corroded, you&#8217;ll need a good wire brush or terminal cleaner to them cleaned up. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Look at the wire going directly from the battery to the starter. &nbsp;Check to see if it is burnt, or if it has taken any sort of damage that could keep it from properly conducting electricity.<\/p>\n<p>If everything looks good with the battery cables and terminals, move on to the neutral safety switch. &nbsp;Try putting your Bravada in neutral and starting the engine. &nbsp;If it starts, that could indicate a bad neutral safety switch, and not a bad starter.<\/p>\n<p>If the neutral safety switch trick doesn&#8217;t work, take a look at the battery and make sure that it doesn&#8217;t look visibly damaged. &nbsp;It may be worth your time to take it and have it tested at the local auto parts store (this is usually a complimentary service) before pulling and replacing the starter itself.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Good luck diagnosing whether or not your Oldsmobile Bravada has a bad starter. &nbsp;If there is anything that you would like to add, please leave a comment below. &nbsp;Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; One of the most common problems that can occur in the life of a vehicle is a bad starter, that includes the Oldsmobile Bravada. &nbsp;It is important to determine whether or not it&#8217;s a bad starter that is keeping the vehicle from turning over.
