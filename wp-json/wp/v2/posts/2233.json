Have somebody stand behind your Escalade, and put it in reverse. Have them tell you if the back up lights come on. If the back up lights don&#8217;t come on that very well could mean that the truck&#8217;s electronics system knows that it is in reverse. This can happen when things get out of alignment. Now that you are back there, go ahead and see if the reverse lights come on in any gear. It may have been a bigger problem than you realized.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bad Camera<\/strong>&#8211; These cameras are exposed to the elements, which means that they have to be pretty durable. They certainly can go bad. With the Cadillac Escalade in particular, they can go out. Tap your inner Fonz, and give it a flick. It very well could turn back on again. If it does come back to life, you know it&#8217;s going bad.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Short Circuit<\/strong>&#8211; While it&#8217;s not the most likely of causes, the a short-circuit can cause the reverse camera to stop functioning . Here&#8217;s a video on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=n5FJDgcdii8\">diagnosing a short<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Blown Fuse<\/strong>&#8211; One of the most common causes of a bad back up camera in the Cadillac Escalade is a bad fuse. The first time that you experience a bad fuse, it should be cause for concern, but not alarm. Go ahead and install a new fuse, and if the problem goes away you&#8217;re good to go. If the problem persists, then it&#8217;s time to look at the possibility that you have a short-circuit.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a good YouTube video on the subject.\u00a0 It&#8217;s for a Tahoe, but <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/chevy-tahoe-backup-camera-not-working\/\">Tahoe backup camera problems<\/a> are the same as an Escalade&#8217;s.\u00a0 It&#8217;s worth the watch.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hMN9ZfB0CZs\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If your Cadillac Escalade has a backup camera that is not working, here are the most common causes and how to troubleshoot them.\u00a0\u00a0A backup camera is something that most truck owners don&#8217;t feel like they need until they have one.
