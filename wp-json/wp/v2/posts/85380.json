&nbsp;It&#8217;s not as safe, especially when it&#8217;s raining, snowing, or the road surface is loose\/uneven. &nbsp;That&#8217;s why we recommend having the ABS system fixed as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Toyota Sequoia ABS Light On Causes<\/h2>\n<p>A good code scanner will often tell you which part of the ABS system has gone bad. &nbsp;Not every OBDII scanner will give up this information. &nbsp;A good one will. &nbsp;Most auto parts stores will have a free scanning service that they would be happy to let you utilize.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the three most common causes of the ABS light coming on:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>1. &nbsp;Wheel Speed Sensor<\/h3>\n<p>The wheel speed sensors are responsible for monitoring the wheel speed and sending it back to the computer system. &nbsp;If one of the wheels is moving slower than the others it on its way to locking up. &nbsp;The ABS then takes activates on that wheel in order to keep it from locking.<\/p>\n<p>When this sensor is no longer sending a signal to your Sequoia&#8217;s ABS system, it is no longer functioning properly and the ABS light will be activated on the dashboard.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. &nbsp;ABS Module<\/h3>\n<p>The antilock brake system runs through the ABS module. &nbsp;This module physically controls the anti-lock brake system &nbsp;If it becomes damaged, and can no longer control all four brakes, the ABS light will activate. &nbsp;Typically, corrosion is the most common reason why the module fails. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/ABS-Light-On-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84983\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/ABS-Light-On-Diagnosis.png\" alt=\"Toyota Sequoia ABS Light On Diagnosis\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/ABS-Light-On-Diagnosis.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/ABS-Light-On-Diagnosis-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>3. &nbsp;ABS Fluid Level<\/h3>\n<p>If the fluid level is too low to keep pressure in the ABS lines, the ABS light will come on. &nbsp;Without the pressure the ABS will no longer be able to physically activate.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>It is not advisable to ignore your Toyota Sequoia&#8217;s ABS light. &nbsp;Most of the time, the wheel speed sensors are going to be what triggers it. &nbsp;If there is anything you would like to add, please leave a comment below. &nbsp;Good luck!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Your Toyota Sequoia&#8217;s ABS Light comes on when it fails a self diagnostic cycle. &nbsp;When on, it indicates that the Sequoia does not have Anti-Lock brakes, and the safety they provide.
