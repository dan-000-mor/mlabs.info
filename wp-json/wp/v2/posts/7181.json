Here are the most common causes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blocked EGR Tube<\/strong>&#8211; The tube that carries the exhaust gases back to the motor may clog up over time. Alternatively, it can become bent or kinked. This is especially true if you are experiencing P0401 right after doing some engine work. Check the tube and see if it is cracked, clogged, or damaged.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Faulty EGR Valve<\/strong>&#8211; The EGR valve is usually not the place to start.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Vacuum Issues<\/strong>&#8211; The EGR valve relies on the engine vacuum to recirculate exhaust gas. So, if you are encountering P0401 and other codes, the P0401 may be a symptom of larger problems. For instance, if the motor is not running well enough to create a sufficient vacuum to operate the EGR system, P0401 will often be thrown.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sensor Issue<\/strong>&#8211; The Differential Pressure Feedback- EGR sensor can go faulty and cause the EGR valve to stop operating properly and throw the code.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>P0401 Fix<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ud60NZuma-A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n\n<p>The good news with P0401 in the Toyota Tundra is that it rarely ever costs much money to fix, and it is usually pretty easy to get the problem since it is right on top of the engine.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most folks see P0401 Insufficient EGR flow, look up the price of an EGR valve, see how cheap it is, and just throw a new one on.&nbsp; That can be a mistake. The EGR valve will not always be the cause of P0401. Here are some of the most common fixes to help clear the P0401:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Check the EGR Tube<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to check the tube going to the EGR.&nbsp; A crimped, broken, or disconnected EGR tube is often the cause of P0401; easy to do, fast, and replacing it is very affordable. If it&#8217;s cracked, you&#8217;ll need to get a new one. If it&#8217;s clogged, you can get away with cleaning it and replacing it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Check DPFE Sensor Voltage<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are good with a voltage meter, test the DPFE sensor voltage. Here&#8217;s a good article on how to do that from <em>It Still Runs<\/em>:<a href=\"https:\/\/itstillruns.com\/test-dpfe-sensor-7964100.html\"> How to Test DPFE Sensor<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Test the EGR Valve<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A vacuum gauge will help determine if the EGR valve has gone bad. Here&#8217;s an article from<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autozone.com\/repairinfo\/common\/repairInfoMain.jsp?targetPage=productsHowToInspect&amp;leftNavPage=productsHowTo&amp;pageId=%090996b43f80a01291&amp;subtitle=test\"> Autozone<\/a> on how to test it with a vacuum gauge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing your EGR system is relatively easy to do. The most challenging aspect is the DPFE sensor.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One by one, you can eliminate the DPFE sensor and EGR tubing.&nbsp; At that point, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll have to replace the EGR valve.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>P0401 is a very common OBDII trouble code that&#8217;ll pop up in the Toyota Tundra.
