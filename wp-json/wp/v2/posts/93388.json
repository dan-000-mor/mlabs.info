&nbsp;If you have a bad wheel bearing, it could feel different. &nbsp;As the bearing wears down, it will allow the tire to move in directions it never was meant to. &nbsp;This effectively changes the wheel alignment repeatedly as you turn, accelerate, and brake.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Worse When Turning<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;Wheel bearing noise will often get worse when you turn. &nbsp;This is particularly true when it&#8217;s the front bearings that have gone bad.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Louder With Speed<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;Typically, bad wheel bearing noise will increase as you increase your Spectra&#8217;s speed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Kia Spectra Bad Wheel Bearing Diagnosis<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Bad-Wheel-Bearing-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-90987\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Bad-Wheel-Bearing-Diagnosis.png\" alt=\"Kia Spectra Bad Wheel Bearing Diagnosis\" width=\"300\" height=\"288\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Test Drive<\/strong>&#8211; The best way to diagnose bearing noise in your Spectra is to take it for a drive. &nbsp;You&#8217;ll be looking to hear the hum increase as the speed picks up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jack and Wiggle<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;With your Spectra on jack stands, you&#8217;ll want to look and see if the wheel is wiggling at the bearing. &nbsp;If it is, that&#8217;s proof positive that you need a new wheel bearing. &nbsp;If it does not wiggle, that does not automatically mean the wheel bearing is good. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You would also want to turn the tire and see if there is an audible noise coming from the bearing. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve put a fantastic YouTube video on this from ChrisFix below. &nbsp;He does all of this. &nbsp;Check it out.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YvKWGjmPKoc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>It is not recommended to drive your Kia Spectra on a bad wheel bearing. &nbsp;They are dangerous. &nbsp;As they go bad they create heat. &nbsp;This heat can eventually cause the tire to lock up while going down the road.<\/p>\n<p>Replacing a wheel bearing is not that expensive, even if you take it in to a shop.
