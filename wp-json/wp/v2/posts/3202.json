Here are the most common problems that will throw the code. \u00a0They are presented somewhat in order from most to least likely to be causing the code:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Low Fuel Pressure<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0If there isn&#8217;t enough fuel getting to the engine, this will cause combustion to be less than optimal. \u00a0Diagnosing low fuel pressure can be tricky. \u00a0Typically, if you do have low fuel pressure, the vehicle will act fine when it doesn&#8217;t need a lot of fuel. \u00a0But, it&#8217;ll sputter and act like it&#8217;s going to die at speed or under heavy acceleration. \u00a0Here&#8217;s some information on how to tell if you have a <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-fuel-filter-symptoms\/\">bad fuel filter.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Vacuum leak<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0If your vehicle has a vacuum leak, it can be very difficult for it to get the right air\/fuel mixture. \u00a0This will cause the cylinders to misfire and it&#8217;ll throw the P0300. \u00a0Also, since a vacuum leak almost always affects each cylinder the same, you&#8217;ll typically get P0300 with it and not any cylinder specific misfire codes. \u00a0Here&#8217;s a great article from <em>Popular Mechanics<\/em> on how to detect a vacuum leak. \u00a0It&#8217;s easy (and kind of fun) to chase one down. \u00a0<em>Popular Mechanics<\/em>: \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.popularmechanics.com\/cars\/how-to\/a3094\/how-to-find-a-vacuum-leak\/\">How to find a vacuum leak<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>EGR Problems<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0If the EGR system is not able to recycle the engine gasses right, it&#8217;ll throw P0300.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ignition Problems<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0Bad plug wires (if equipped), bad coil packs, and spark plugs can cause misfires to occur. \u00a0This isn&#8217;t higher on the list because typically you&#8217;ll get a misfire in one cylinder specifically, and not a P0300 only. \u00a0If you got a P302 or something similar with the P0300, it may be a good idea to check and see if there is any damage or failure from your ignition components. \u00a0Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebay.com\/gds\/How-to-Test-a-Coil-Pack-\/10000000205702258\/g.html\">how to test a coil pack<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C6A1keWQAeE\">how to tell if a spark plug is bad<\/a> (video), and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=12t_5ngXaTQ\">how to test plug wires<\/a>\u00a0(video).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cam or Crank Sensors<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0This one is very unlikely, but it does happen. \u00a0If the ECU is not getting the right signal from these sensors, the vehicles timing is not going to sync up and it&#8217;ll misfire.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Low Compression<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0If you have a leaking head gasket, bent valve, cracked head, etc.. that would cause compression to not be as high as it should, you&#8217;re going to get P0300. \u00a0You should also feel the vehicle is down on power as well.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Most Common P0300 Fixes<\/h2>\n<p>A lot of the time, P0300 is going to be fixed by something obvious, such as an EGR leak. \u00a0When it&#8217;s not glaringly obvious what is wrong, a <strong>tune up<\/strong> is a great place to start.<\/p>\n<p>Replacing the spark plugs, coil packs, and plug wires is not typically difficult or costly.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>Is P0300 a Serious Concern?<\/h2>\n<p>P0300 is cause for concern and left unfixed can get worse. \u00a0Fixing the problem causing the code to fire can save you time and money and keep your Chevy from breaking down.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Chevy P0300 Diagnosis<\/h2>\n<p>P0300 is serious enough that you should take your vehicle in to have it looked at if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing under the hood, but if you do, here are the recommended tools for getting the job done.<\/p>\n<p>OBDII Scanner: \u00a0<a class=\"aawp-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01G5EA74I?tag=700r4hq-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\" title=\"ANCEL AD310 Classic Enhanced Universal OBD II Scanner Car Engine Fault Code Reader CAN Diagnostic...\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"  data-aawp-product-id=\"B01G5EA74I\" data-aawp-product-title=\"ANCEL AD310 Classic Enhanced Universal OBD II Scanner Car Engine Fault Code Reader CAN Diagnostic Scan Tool-Black\">ANCEL AD310 Classic Enhanced Universal OBD II Scanner Car Engine Fault Code Reader CAN Diagnostic...<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Fuel Pressure Tester: \u00a0<a class=\"aawp-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0009XQUKC?tag=700r4hq-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\" title=\"Actron CP7838 Professional Fuel Pressure Tester\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"  data-aawp-product-id=\"B0009XQUKC\" data-aawp-product-title=\"Actron CP7838 Professional Fuel Pressure Tester\">Actron CP7838 Professional Fuel Pressure Tester<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Leak Down Tester: \u00a0<a class=\"aawp-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0030EVL60?tag=700r4hq-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\" title=\"OTC 5609 Cylinder Leakage Tester Kit , black\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"  data-aawp-product-id=\"B0030EVL60\" data-aawp-product-title=\"OTC 5609 Cylinder Leakage Tester Kit  black\">OTC 5609 Cylinder Leakage Tester Kit , black<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Combustion Leak Tester: \u00a0<a class=\"aawp-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B06VVBSFTF?tag=700r4hq-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\" title=\"Block Tester BT-500 Combustion Leak Test Kit - Made in USA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"  data-aawp-product-id=\"B06VVBSFTF\" data-aawp-product-title=\"Block Tester BT-500 Combustion Leak Test Kit - Made in USA\">Block Tester BT-500 Combustion Leak Test Kit - Made in USA<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>P0300 is one of the most common OBDII codes that occur in Chevy vehicles. \u00a0It stands for: P0300: Random Multiple Misfire Detected P0300 is certainly a cause for concern, and can be a threat to the drivability of your Chevy.
