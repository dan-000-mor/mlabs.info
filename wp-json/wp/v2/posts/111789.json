Cadillac XLR<\/h2>\n<p>Here are the most common symptoms of a bad serpentine belt in the Cadillac XLR:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Squealing Belt<\/h3>\n<p>Often, the first sign of a bad serpentine belt in your XLR is squealing.&nbsp; The squealing should match the engine RPM.&nbsp; That is to say, that when you rev the engine, the squeal changes pitch accordingly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It might also go away entirely if you rev your engine a few times.&nbsp; This happens because the serpentine belt gets heat in it and is able to grab ahold of the pulleys.&nbsp; At this point it is no longer slipping.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a matter of time before revving the engine no longer corrects the problem.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_111685\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-111685\" style=\"width: 291px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Bad-Serpentine-Belt-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-111685\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Bad-Serpentine-Belt-Diagnosis.png\" alt=\"Cadillac XLR Bad Serpentine Belt Diagnosis\" width=\"301\" height=\"216\"><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-111685\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Typical Serpentine Belt<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h3>Visible Wear and Cracking on the Belt<\/h3>\n<p>As your serpentine belt ages, it will begin to show visible signs of wear.&nbsp; These belts are not designed to last the life of an engine.&nbsp; A bad serpentine belt may have:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glazing<\/li>\n<li>Cracks<\/li>\n<li>Smooth Surface<\/li>\n<li>Missing Pieces<\/li>\n<li>Uneven Wear<\/li>\n<li>Missing\/Damaged Ribs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Any of these items are enough to replace the belt.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Engine Accessories Not Working<\/h3>\n<p>The serpentine belt powers your engine accessories, such as the power steering pump and air conditioning compressor.&nbsp; If these accessories are not working, that&#8217;s an indication that the serpentine belt is shot or missing entirely.&nbsp; Get a new belt immediately.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Overheating<\/h3>\n<p>The serpentine belt is responsible for turning the water pump in your XLR.&nbsp; If it fails, water can no longer circulate throughout the engine.&nbsp; You also shouldn&#8217;t have power steering (although some vehicles now have electric power steering so be careful).<\/p>\n<p>If the belt is off all the way, or the engine is overheating, do not drive it somewhere to have it looked at.&nbsp; Overheating the engine and <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Cadillac-XLR-blown-head-gasket\/\">blowing a head gasket<\/a> will cost way more than a new serpentine belt.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Cadillac XLR Serpentine Belt Replacement<\/h2>\n<p>Replacing a serpentine belt is a straightforward process.&nbsp; Your XLR uses a tensioner to keep the serpentine belt tight.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The first thing you are going to need to do is find the tensioner and apply force to it in order to loosen the serpentine belt.&nbsp; Once you&#8217;ve applied force you can pull the belt off of a pulley.&nbsp; Now, let off the tensioner slowly.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend taking a picture of the belt route, and making sure that you have a diagram of the route before taking the belt off.&nbsp; The last thing you want is to not remember how to get the belt back on.&nbsp; You should see a sticker under your XLR&#8217;s hood with serpentine belt route information.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a great video from Scotty Kilmer on how to change a serpentine belt:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/O4aqIiWR9JU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion:&nbsp; Bad Serpentine Belt Diagnosis &#8211; XLR<\/h2>\n<p>Serpentine belt replacement is something that any shade tree mechanic can do with very few tools.&nbsp; So if you have reason to believe that a bad serpentine belt is causing your Cadillac XLR&#8217;s engine to squeal, replacing it might be exactly what you need to do.<\/p>\n<p>If there is anything that you would like to add, please leave a comment below.&nbsp;
