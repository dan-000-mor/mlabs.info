&nbsp;If you couldn&#8217;t feel three distinct clicks as the gears changed, you very well could have an issue with the transmission going into the gear you are looking for. &nbsp;There&#8217;s a reason that this is before the next item. &nbsp;It only takes a second to do and can save you a ton of money if it is the cause.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Band Failure<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;Most of the time the overdrive gear is going to fail to engage due to the wearing of the band for the Overdrive. &nbsp;The servo will no longer be able to engage it because of this wear. &nbsp;This is the physical problems that stops overdrive most of the time if no other issue is detected. &nbsp;Bands are <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2FbTDEm\">pretty affordable<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Related:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/4l60e-transmission-problems\/\">4L60E Transmission Problems<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The 4L60E is a for speed automatic transmission with a .70 overdrive. &nbsp;The overdrive gear is gear number four. &nbsp;As the 4L60E ages, one of the most common problems that it develops is that it won&#8217;t shift into overdrive anymore.
