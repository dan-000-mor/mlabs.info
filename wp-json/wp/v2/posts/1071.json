Particularly, because when the vehicle owner asks for a transmission fluid change, the maintenance technician will concentrate their efforts on draining out all of the dirty fluid from the transmission, while a transmission flush is meant to get rid of all the fluid inside of the pan, the torque converter and its cooler lines. So, there is a significant difference in which one the vehicle owner chooses.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Above, we listed the physical differences. \u00a0But, just as important, there are heavy cost differences. \u00a0A transmission flush is significantly more expensive than a fluid change. \u00a0Is it even necessary to pay the extra money for the flush? \u00a0They need to give you good reason that justifies the flush, such as:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metal shavings in the pan. \u00a0This may mean that your transmission is doomed anyway, but shavings will finish it off quick.<\/li>\n<li>The factory maintenance schedule calls for it. \u00a0It is not often that they do call for a flush anymore, but as vehicles creep into extremely high mileage situations, the manufacturer may call for it.<\/li>\n<li>There&#8217;s burnt transmission fluid. \u00a0If the technician can show you that your transmission fluid is burnt, a flush may be warranted. \u00a0You should still check the fluid yourself for a burnt condition. \u00a0Pull the dipstick and make sure that the fluid is actually a dark color. \u00a0Make sure to deposit that transmission fluid onto a white paper towel or piece of paper. \u00a0If you are shown your clean fluid on a shop towel, it is certainly going to look darker than it really is. \u00a0Here is a fantastic guide that covers <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/what-color-is-transmission-fluid\/\">what does the color of your transmission fluid mean<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Your car has been used in a heavy-duty fashion. \u00a0 Heavy duty If your car has been used for something like driving for \u00fcber causes the same <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/uber\/comments\/42j88c\/how_to_maintain_your_car_and_keep_it_from_getting\/\">wear and tear<\/a> on the vehicle that a taxi does. \u00a0Therefore, the transmission should be treated just like a taxi&#8217;s. \u00a0This means a frequent maintenance schedule that involves flushes when they normally wouldn&#8217;t be done.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are some reasons not to get a flush:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your manufacturer may not want you to. \u00a0The company that made your vehicle is definitely going to want what&#8217;s best for your vehicle. \u00a0Vehicle longevity is big selling point. \u00a0One manufacturer that has a stellar reliability record is Honda. \u00a0They typically recommend that you drain out a portion of the fluid and replace that amount to not shock the system. \u00a0As your fluid circulates around the clutches and servos it gets (for lack of a better term) seasoned. \u00a0This seasoned oil can really develop a life of its own. \u00a0By replacing a small portion of it, you are insuring that there will be no shock.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s typically very costly, much more so than just getting the change done. \u00a0If there is no reason to get one done that you can justify to yourself, just get it changed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Transmission Fluid Change<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When the maintenance technician does a fluid change, their responsibility is to make sure the pan is completely drained and the transmission filter is replaced. In this process, all of the fluid will not be removed. \u00a0 Especially because a huge chunk of this fluid will be left inside the torque converter as well as the cooler lines. It is also important to note that there are both pros and cons to this service and they are listed as follows:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pros:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is significantly more affordable than getting it flushed. \u00a0Since most of us have to watch where are money is going, the change (or partial change) is the cost-effective option.<\/li>\n<li>Vehicle owners can teach themselves to do the transmission fluid change themselves. \u00a0It&#8217;s not that difficult to do, especially if the transmission involved has a fluid drain plug. \u00a0Not all of them do. \u00a0If changing your own oil is a 3 out of 10 in the difficulty arena, than changing the transmission fluid is about a solid 5. \u00a0Still doable. \u00a0If you are going to give it a shot, practice a few times by getting comfortable with changing the oil yourself.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cons:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You won&#8217;t get all of the old fluid out. \u00a0If there has been an issue that leads you to believe that you may have harmed the transmission, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/low-transmission-fluid-signs\/\">low transmission fluid<\/a> or drag racing, a flush may be more appropriate for your vehicle.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Some people may say that the transmission flush is superior to the fluid change. Specifically, because none of the old fluid is left behind. Therefore, any contaminates that could adversely affect the transmission are no longer a threat to its proper functioning.<\/p>\n<p>All things being equal, many vehicle owners would prefer a flush and not a change. With a flush, all of the fluids are removed from the pan, cooler line and the torque converter. As a result, the new transmission fluid is not mixed with any of the old dirty fluids. Meaning the transmission will perform at its peak efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>Before a vehicle owner takes their car in for transmission servicing, it is essential that they understand the differences between a transmission fluid change and a transmission fluid flush. Since both of which have pros and cons, people should make sure that they understand an overview of each so that they can make an informed decision.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When a vehicle owner drives into any car maintenance facility, they may or may not know what services they really need to keep their car running smooth and efficiently. \u00a0It&#8217;s easy to be taken advantage of. \u00a0They may need the technician to explain a little bit more about the ins and outs of maintaining their &#8230; <a title=\"Transmission Fluid Change vs Flush\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/transmission-fluid-change-vs-flush\/\" aria-label=\"More on Transmission Fluid Change vs Flush\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11,1],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1071"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1071"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1071\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1071"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1071"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1071"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
