It means electronic control. \u00a0The shift solenoids are the means by which this control is physically achieved within the transmission.<\/p>\n<p>Shift solenoids are relatively basic in design and principal. \u00a0Simply put, the shift solenoid has a spring loaded plunger inside of it that will move transmission fluid in and out of different parts of the transmission. \u00a0This action makes the transmission shift into different gears.<\/p>\n<p>This movement is achieved through the creation of a magnetic field within them.<\/p>\n<h2>4L60E Shift Solenoid Symptoms<\/h2>\n<p>Here are the main <strong>symptoms of a bad 4L60E shift solenoid<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Failure to Downshift<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0The 4L60E will often fail to downshift if one or more of the shift solenoids are stuck open or closed. \u00a0This is due to the fact that the transmission fluid cannot be rerouted to the part of the transmission that would be making the next move. \u00a0To put it simply, it is stuck doing what it was doing when the solenoid failed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Delay Going in Gear\/ Between Gears<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0If there is a long pause between gear selection and engagement, it can often be attributed to a faulty shift solenoid. \u00a0Furthermore, if there seems to be a lot of time between when the transmission exits one gear and enters another, than it&#8217;s a pretty good indication of a bad shift solenoid.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Inconsistent Shifting<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0Often when a shift solenoid goes bad in the 4L60E, it&#8217;ll cause a lot of erratic shift behavior. \u00a0The transmission will skip gears. \u00a0It also may act like it is trying to &#8220;find the right gear&#8221;. \u00a0Or, to put it another way, it&#8217;s can&#8217;t quite settle on the right gear.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stuck in Neutral<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0If a shift solenoid has failed entirely, that it&#8217;s entirely possible that the transmission will not work at all. \u00a0In this situation the transitional will remain a neutral regardless of what gear you put it in.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>4L60E Shift Solenoid Failure Diagnosis<\/h2>\n<p>Most of the problems that occur with a 4L60E shift solenoid are caused by the coil wire going bad in some way. \u00a0It can go bad in a couple of ways. \u00a0The plunger can also get stuck. \u00a0We&#8217;ll cover the why and the how here.<\/p>\n<p>You can test the solenoids with an OHM meter. \u00a0You should be looking for 20-30 ohms of resistance. \u00a0If no resistance is found, than you know that the solenoid is bad, and that it is broken. \u00a0If the reading is less than 20 ohms than it&#8217;s probably melted. \u00a0There&#8217;s more on both of those conditions and what causes them directly below.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Broken Solenoid Coil Wire<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0In the event that the 4L60E solenoid coil wire breaks, the solenoid will no loner be able to create the magnetic field. \u00a0A broken shift solenoid wire is going to be caused by a lot of <strong>harsh vibration<\/strong>, or <strong>high voltage<\/strong> that&#8217;s out of the normal range.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Melted Solenoid Coil Wire<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0The results of a melted solenoid coil wire are the same as a broken one, the difference is going to be the conditions that caused the wire to melt. \u00a0Whereas a \u00a0broken coil wire is likely to be caused by vibration or high voltage, a melted one is going to be caused extreme <strong>transmission temperature<\/strong> or\u00a0<strong>high voltage<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Plunger Stuck<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0The solenoid plunger is an area of failure in the 4L60E. \u00a0Unlike when the shift solenoids are melted or broken, a stuck plunger can be repaired. \u00a0Shift solenoids are not expensive. \u00a0It would be a good idea to replace it if you can afford it. This will keep you from getting under the truck next time the plunger decides to get stuck.<\/p>\n<p>A stuck plunger is almost always caused by dirty transmission fluid or debris in the case. You&#8217;ll have to replace the transmission fluid anyway, but it&#8217;s a good idea to go ahead and change the filter as well. \u00a0This will really help increase the odds that you won&#8217;t be making this repair again anytime soon.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Broken\/Stuck Spring<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0There is a spring in the shift solenoid that moves the plunger forward, when it is damaged that movement cannot happen.<\/p>\n<h2>4L60E Shift Solenoid Testing<\/h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a good video of a an average do it yourself testing the shift solenoids. \u00a0It&#8217;s pretty helpful.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XkX7VXg8t2g\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Modern automatic transmissions use hydraulic fluid, which is activated by solenoids, to shift gears. \u00a0In the 4L60E, shift solenoid problems can cause a lot of trouble. \u00a0The purpose of this article is to help you identify 4L60E shift solenoid symptoms. \u00a0The good news is, that if you do have a bad one, they&#8217;re really inexpensive. &#8230; <a title=\"4L60E Shift Solenoid Symptoms and Diagnosis\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/4l60e-shift-solenoid-symptoms-and-diagnosis\/\" aria-label=\"More on 4L60E Shift Solenoid Symptoms and Diagnosis\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[8,3],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1854"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1854"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1854\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1854"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1854"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1854"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
