There are three major reasons why oiling issues will cause your G90 to knock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The knocking sound isn&#8217;t as deep as throwing a rod, but it&#8217;s very noticeable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>No oil at all<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lack of oil pressure (oil pump, worn engine, or sludge buildup from infrequent oil changes)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Water or coolant in the oil.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bad Spark Plugs<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Engine-Knock-Causes.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Engine-Knock-Causes.jpg\" alt=\"Genesis G90 Engine Knock Causes\" class=\"wp-image-109431\" width=\"502\" height=\"498\"\/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio\"><audio controls src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Spark-Knock.mp3\"><\/audio><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Spark Knock<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A prevalent reason that your G90&#8217;s engine will knock is bad spark plugs. &nbsp;Spark plugs are vital to proper engine combustion. &nbsp;There must be a solid spark to achieve clean combustion. When the spark plugs aren&#8217;t burning right, your car will spark knock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, spark plugs can fail for a few different reasons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wrong Plug<\/strong>&#8211; If you aren&#8217;t using the spark plug recommended by Genesis, it would be a good idea to go ahead and swap them for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=genesis+tacoma+spark+plugs&amp;ref=nav_ya_signin&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=75753649c9b263b977ecc3bbf8b005a0&amp;language=en_US\">correct plug<\/a>. &nbsp;The wrong plug can burn too hot or cold, which has a direct effect on the combustion and cause engine knocking.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Worn-Out Plug<\/strong>&#8211; Spark plugs can wear out over time. &nbsp;You need to replace the spark plugs at the recommended intervals. &nbsp;If you have high mileage or the plugs look worn, go ahead and change them all.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improper Gap<\/strong>&#8211; Almost all modern vehicles take pre-gapped spark plugs. But you should still check the gap when you install them. Now and then, you&#8217;ll be surprised by one. Check your gap if you&#8217;ve recently had your G90&#8217;s plugs replaced and you&#8217;re now hearing a knock.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Spark Timing<\/strong>&#8211; All of the internal parts of your Genesis G90&#8217;s engine, as well as the sensors and computer, coordinate the engine timing so that the spark plug fires at precisely the right moment. &nbsp;If something is off with this timing, the fuel will fire at the wrong time, and there can be a knock.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Spark plugs are the most common part of the ignition system that can cause your G90 to knock, and definitely where you should start looking. &nbsp;But there are other parts, such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-coil-pack-symptoms-genesis-g90\/\">coil packs<\/a> and plug wires (if equipped), that you should be looking at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The coil pack sends a spark to your car&#8217;s plugs. &nbsp;If they send a weak spark, the air\/fuel mixture will not be able to properly fire, no matter how good the spark plugs are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See also:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/timing-chain-jumped-symptoms-and-diagnosis\/\">Timing Chain Jumped Symptoms and Diagnosis<\/a><br><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/genesis-g90-bad-timing-belt\/\">Genesis G90: Bad Timing Belt or Chain Symptoms<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rod Knock\/Worn Bearings<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Engine-Rods.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Engine-Rods.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-301444\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Engine-Rods.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Engine-Rods-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio\"><audio controls src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rod-Knock.mp3\"><\/audio><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Rod Knock<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A rod knock is perhaps the easiest knock type to identify. It&#8217;s deep and loud. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rod bearings exist in between the crankshaft and piston connecting rods. &nbsp;When they wear out, the space between the rod bearings and connecting rods grows. As the crank turns in a circle, the connecting rods bang into the bearing and make a deep knocking sound.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your G90 has a sound coming from it like the sound above, the engine will need a rebuild or replacement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Other Causes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are other knocking causes, but they aren&#8217;t as common as the ones listed above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Carbon Deposits<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbon can form at the top of your G90&#8217;s combustion chamber. &nbsp;This effectively increases the compression ratio. &nbsp;Too much compression can lead to detonation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern fuels are required to keep carbon cleaning detergents mixed in with them. &nbsp;Even so, deposits still build, leading to a knocking sound. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is the case, you will need to bring your G90 into a shop to have it cleaned. &nbsp;You could also try one of those cleaners in a bottle, although we recommend getting it to a professional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Wrong Octane\/Bad Gas<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Bad fuel can cause your G90&#8217;s engine to knock. &nbsp;The <em>wrong fuel<\/em> can also cause a knocking sound. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using fuel with the proper octane rating is essential. &nbsp;If you need to be using premium fuel, use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Air\/Fuel Mixture Too Lean<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Sensor issues can cause the air\/fuel mixture to lean out. &nbsp;If the mixture gets incredibly lean, it can cause your G90&#8217;s engine to knock. &nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-fuel-injector-symptoms-genesis-g90\/\">Bad fuel injectors<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-oxygen-sensor-symptoms-genesis-g90\/\">oxygen sensors<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/genesis-g90-bad-mass-airflow-sensor\/\">MAF sensor<\/a>, and more can cause a lean air\/fuel mixture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Knock Sensor<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern engines use a knock sensor to correct knocking automatically. &nbsp;If the knock sensor goes bad, then the motor can knock. &nbsp;A bad knock sensor will often throw a trouble code, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0325-genesis-g90\/\">P0325<\/a> (knock sensor &#8220;1&#8221;).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Exhaust Leak<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>An exhaust leak at or around the exhaust can make a noise, often mistaken for a knocking sound.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Above, we identified the most common causes of knocking in the Genesis G90.
