Never let them tell you they are charging you more because labor took longer than expected. \u00a0That is on them. \u00a0Now that you have this in mind, you&#8217;re going to need to do a little research, and a little math.<\/p>\n<p>Get a few estimates and make sure to plug it into this formula:<\/p>\n<div class=\"content-box-blue\"><strong>(<span style=\"color: #008000;\">Labor Hourly Rate<\/span> x <span style=\"color: #993300;\">Hours to Complete Job<\/span>) +<span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"> Parts Cost<\/span>= Total\u00a0Repair Cost<\/strong><\/div>\n<p>You can use this formula for each shop that you call. \u00a0This will help you get an idea of how to get the best price. \u00a0While the full rate Before you even so much as go in to get your first estimate try Googling how many hours to change clutch (insert your model here). \u00a0It&#8217;s great if you can go in knowing about how long it should take.<\/p>\n<h3>How to pick a good shop<\/h3>\n<p>This may sound crazy, but I think one of the best ways that you can find a good clutch shop is to go to the yellow pages. \u00a0I know it&#8217;s 2016 (or it was when I wrote this), but you want to find some old guy who has been doing this for a long time. \u00a0That guy you are looking for has probably been in the book for a very long time. \u00a0Just look up manual transmission repair, or transmission repair depending on where you live.<\/p>\n<p>If you are finding yourself having a hard time, you can also try and find a shop that deals exclusively with foreign cars. \u00a0Imported cars tend to have a higher percentage of standard shift models. \u00a0These guys will be able to fix your clutch as well.<\/p>\n<h3>When is it clutch replacement time?<\/h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ll know its is time to replace your clutch if you run across the following conditions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The smell of rotten eggs. \u00a0Clutches will stink when they begin to slip. \u00a0They often stink as they heat up.<\/li>\n<li>If the engine revs higher all of the sudden while going down the highway, or if you have a heavy load, or if you are going up a rather large hill. \u00a0These can be early warning signs that the clutch is failing you. \u00a0On the other hand, if you smell burning oil you may be leaking oil onto your flywheel. \u00a0Check your engine oil level and then look under where you normally park the car. \u00a0Is their fresh oil?<\/li>\n<li>If you have a really bad chatter or jerking feeling when you take off you may have a warped flywheel or disk. \u00a0The grip is compromised and it will probably need replacement.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Just remember, price isn&#8217;t everything. \u00a0If you get two quotes that are close, but the clutch shop guy tells you he&#8217;s done your make and model more times than he can count, go with that guy to repair your clutch.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was listening to an episode of\u00a0Carcast\u00a0with Adam Carolla one time. \u00a0I believe he was talking about\u00a0finding the right guy to repair a dent in his car. \u00a0He said something along the lines of you don&#8217;t want a guy named Ashton touching this thing. \u00a0You want an old guy with a name like Duke or &#8230; <a title=\"Finding a Good Clutch Repair Shop\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/clutch-repair-shop\/\" aria-label=\"More on Finding a Good Clutch Repair Shop\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/528"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=528"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/528\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=528"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=528"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=528"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
