A trouble code is a code thrown out by an automatic transmission whenever it detects that there is an issue going on. In the case of the P0700, it is a general code. This means that it should be accompanied by some other code that should tell you the specific problem. It is a OBDII code and not just a GM code. If you get no other code it means that there is probably something wrong, but there is no further information. Below you&#8217;ll find some of the common causes for the P0700 in your Silverado.

You may need to have the vehicle scanned further to figure out what is exactly wrong. Does the vehicle feel different? Or is it a situation where you wouldn&#8217;t know anything was wrong if the light wasn&#8217;t on.<\/p>\n<p>Before you take it in to be looked at by a mechanic, you should at least check and make sure that the transmission isn&#8217;t low on fluid. If you have felt a change in the way the vehicle has been driving, make sure you know the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/low-transmission-fluid-signs\/\">signs of low transmission fluid<\/a>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t want to end up spending a ton of money on taking it to a transmission repair specialist to find out that it could have been fixed just by adding some transmission fluid.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>How to Check for the P0700 Code<\/h2>\n<p>The easiest way to check for any trouble code with a vehicle is to get a <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2Bwg0Bw\">OBD2 scanner<\/a>. They are cheap and worth their weight in gold. Otherwise, you can always take your car to the nearest discount auto parts store (Autozone, NAPA, etc..) and they&#8217;ll be happy to go ahead and run the test for you.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, once you find the code, it&#8217;s not time to stop scanning. Let the scanner tell you all of the trouble codes that the vehicles ECM has and google them, just like you googled this one.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>What To Do, or What Your Mechanic Will Do<\/h2>\n<p>The first thing that the mechanic will do is plug-in their OBDII scanner and see what code accompanies the P0700. As stated above, it can be anything. But, it&#8217;s often thrown when there are <strong>shift solenoid issues<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>After that they&#8217;ll go ahead and clear the code and take the vehicle for a road test. This is normal. They want to recreate the problem. If it was a one-off thing, there&#8217;s no reason to replace the part yet. If there is a real problem, the code will almost certainly throw again immediately.<\/p>\n<p>Before you take it in, make sure that you check the transmission fluid. It&#8217;s also a good idea to go ahead and have a look at the fluid itself. If the fluid is a rough color, or worse you find metal flakes in it, that can be a sign that the transmission is going out.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to tell what the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/what-color-is-transmission-fluid\/\">color of your transmission fluid is telling you<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The Code is almost always accompanied by another code. There are vehicle specific trouble codes and there are codes specifically for your manufacturer.
