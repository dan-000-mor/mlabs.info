Their purpose is to make it easier for other drivers to see you, theoretically decreasing the odds of getting into an accident. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Liberty&#8217;s DRL warning light is on, the powertrain control module (commonly referred to as the PCM, your vehicle&#8217;s central computer) has detected an issue with the DRL system.  A bad bulb is the most prevalent reason why the DRL warning light is on.  Replacing it should remedy the problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is it Safe to Drive with The DRL Warning Light On?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/DRL-Warning-Light.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/DRL-Warning-Light-1024x1019.jpg\" alt=\"Can You Drive with the DRL Light On\" class=\"wp-image-256517\" width=\"336\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/DRL-Warning-Light-1024x1019.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/DRL-Warning-Light-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/DRL-Warning-Light-768x765.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/DRL-Warning-Light.jpg 1330w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The daytime running light system is designed to help your Liberty stay visible to drivers under various low light conditions, such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Driving in and out of tunnels<\/li><li>Fog<\/li><li>Dawn and dusk<\/li><li>Storms<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It is perfectly safe to drive if your DRL warning light is on.  However, if you are concerned about losing the slight gain in visibility generated by the daytime running lights, you can drive with your regular headlights on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DRL warning light is not a breakdown risk, and a Subaru Liberty will still run and drive fine with it on.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the model year, some DRL systems are tied to the headlights, and you should make sure that the normal headlights are working correctly.  You don&#8217;t want to discover that they aren&#8217;t when you&#8217;re driving at night.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Subaru Liberty DRL Warning Light: Causes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"DRL Warning Fix Subaru Liberty\" class=\"wp-image-190153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two types of daytime running light systems.  Since this is not a model year-specific guide, your Liberty could have either version.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Independent Bulb<\/strong>: Your Liberty&#8217;s DRL system will have its own independent bulbs.  This scenario is easier to test and diagnose.<\/li><li><strong>Headlight Integration<\/strong>:  The system can be integrated into the headlights or parking lights (this is increasingly more common).  Fire up your Liberty&#8217;s headlights and see if all the bulbs are working.  If one is burnt out, replace it.  <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are unsure which type of bulb your daytime running lights use, check the owner&#8217;s manual for the replacement bulb numbers.  If the bulb numbers for the headlights are the same as the DRL lights, it&#8217;s likely that they are integrated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the most common causes that the DRL warning light might come on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bad Bulb (Most Common Reason)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A bad daytime running lightbulb\/headlight is the most common reason the Subaru Liberty&#8217;s DRL warning light comes on<\/strong>.  Replacing it will likely turn the warning light off.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your daytime running lights are on their own independent circuit, examine the bulbs.  One of them should look noticeably burnt out.  If they look good, take a look at the socket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bad Socket<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before running out and replacing the bulbs, pull one and make sure that the socket looks OK.  If the socket is corroded or damaged, it&#8217;s likely the reason why the DRL warning light is on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often when a socket is bad, it can be hard to pull the bulb out.  If this is the case with your scenario, wear some leather gloves, or get a thick rag to protect your hands from potential breakage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the socket is corroded or looks like it&#8217;s melted, you can splice a new one into the harness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Other DRL Warning Light Causes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While a bad bulb or socket will cover the majority of the people reading this page, here are some of the other (less likely) causes that can cause the Liberty&#8217;s DRL warning light to come on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Bad DRL Module<\/li><li>Open or short in the wiring harness<\/li><li>Blown fuse<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common reason that the DRL warning light is on is a bad bulb.  Most of the time, replacing it will fix the problem.
