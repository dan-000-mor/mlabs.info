Each of those warnings has a unique error code to help with the diagnosis.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>P0234 is a standard OBD2 trouble code that can occur in the Taurus. In layman&#8217;s terms, it indicates a potential problem with an engine&#8217;s forced induction system, and you should only see it if your car is turbocharged. Too much boost can trigger the sensor to turn on the check engine light. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#fd8c8c69\">This warning code requires immediate attention to prevent costly damage to your Taurus&#8217;s engine. <strong>You should not drive with P0234<\/strong>.&nbsp; Assuming the engine is getting too much boost, it can blow a head or intake gasket, increasing the repair expense considerably.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a generic code. However, the engine type and model year of your Ford will determine the repair steps needed. This article has been written for a turbocharged vehicle with P0234. It&#8217;s rare to find this code on a supercharged vehicle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>P0234: Quick Info<\/h2>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Ford-Taurus.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Ford-Taurus.jpg\" alt=\"Ford Taurus P0234\" class=\"wp-image-272047\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Ford-Taurus.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Ford-Taurus-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Definition<\/strong><\/td><td>Ford Taurus P0234: Turbocharger or Supercharger &#8220;A&#8221; Overboost Condition<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Common Causes<\/strong><\/td><td>Bad\/Damaged Wastegate Valve, Wastegate Control Solenoid, Wastegate Control Hose Blockage, Bad Turbo Charger<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Symptoms<\/strong><\/td><td>Check Engine Light, Limp Mode<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Repair Difficulty?<\/strong><\/td><td>Difficult, Best Left to a Professional<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Breakdown Risk?<\/strong><\/td><td>Yes.

Overboosting can damage the engine.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you attempt to fix p0234, start by checking the boost sensor before assuming your Taurus is overboosted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repairing P0234 can be challenging, and best left to the professionals, but there are a few things you can do before going that route.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s an excellent order to diagnose possible issues with the P0234 code in the Ford Taurus:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are There Other Codes?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing you should do is check for other codes.&nbsp; If there aren\u2019t any codes related to the MAP\/MAF or boost sensors, it\u2019s likely a mechanical issue causing P0234.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Examine the Boost Pressure Sensor\u2019s Electrical Connection<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Boost-Pressure-Sensor.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Boost-Pressure-Sensor-1024x855.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-281227\" width=\"257\" height=\"215\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Boost-Pressure-Sensor-1024x855.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Boost-Pressure-Sensor-300x251.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Boost-Pressure-Sensor-768x642.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Boost-Pressure-Sensor-1536x1283.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Boost-Pressure-Sensor.jpg 1858w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px\" \/><\/a><figcaption>A typical boost pressure sensor.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If the electrical connection that runs between the your Taurus&#8217;s boost pressure sensor circuit has become compromised, the code can illuminate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the wiring harness going to the boost pressure sensor for any damage.&nbsp; Its proximity to the hot exhaust system can cause these wires to become warn and brittle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Check the Boost Pressure Sensor<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on how your Taurus&#8217;s turbo is set up, the boost pressure sensor can bolt directly into the turbo system, or it can have a vacuum line that runs to it. The vacuum line type is susceptible to damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The boost pressure sensor could also be clogged.&nbsp; If connected via a hose, examine that hose to see if it is cracked or clogged.&nbsp; If it is, clean it out or replace it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test your Taurus&#8217;s boost pressure sensor. Here\u2019s an article that details <a href=\"https:\/\/autoditex.com\/page\/boost-pressure-sensor-bps-24-1.html\">how to test a boost pressure sensor<\/a>. Keep in mind that P0234 is more often than not caused by a mechanical issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Take a Look at the Wastegate Controller<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"VAG Overboost Fault - P0234 - Turbo Repair Step By Step Guide\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MIyVfL98qr8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>This video does a tremendous job of showing how to diagnose and repair a turbocharger that has P0234.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There might be an issue with the wastegate connecting rod. Your Taurus&#8217;s owner&#8217;s manual should have the recommended PSI for the wastegate controller. If it doesn&#8217;t, call the dealer and ask. The rod might need an adjustment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is the Wastegate Jammed?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your car&#8217;s wastegate becomes jammed, that will force the turbine to spin faster. That can create an over-boosted engine situation. Typically, this will happen when the connecting rod has become bent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Faulty turbocharger or supercharger<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, the most straightforward explanations are the simplest ones. For example, the P0234 code could result from a defective turbocharger or supercharger. Replacing them would clear the code and get your Ford Taurus back on the road.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We recommend taking your vehicle in to a shop to have it tested before attempting to service the turbo or supercharger yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A P0234 code in the Ford Taurus is a severe problem. Don\u2019t drive if your vehicle has it.&nbsp; If you do, you risk blowing the engine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, it is also the type of repair best handled by professional mechanics.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your Ford Taurus&#8217;s electrical system provides early warning signs of possible trouble.
