Check the Coolant Level<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-180317 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Check-Coolant.jpg\" alt=\"P2181 Causes:  Audi TT\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Check-Coolant.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Check-Coolant-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Make sure that you check the coolant level before doing anything else. &nbsp;It very well could be that the coolant is empty if you are getting P2181. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If it is empty, you&#8217;ll need to add more coolant. Never add coolant to an overheating engine, as that can cause a head to crack. &nbsp;You&#8217;ll need to find where the leak is coming from. &nbsp;Start by looking under the vehicle and seeing if you can find any dripping coolant. &nbsp;Follow the drips up to the source. &nbsp;This can be more challenging than it sounds.<\/p>\n<p>If coolant is full, it&#8217;s time to test the temperature sending unit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. Test the Temperature Sending Unit<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-180318 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Auto-Temperature-Gauge.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Auto-Temperature-Gauge.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Auto-Temperature-Gauge-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Since this code is indicating that the perceived engine temperature is out of range, it would be best to first take a look at the TT&#8217;s temperature sensor and make sure that it is functioning properly.<\/p>\n<p>You can skip to 3a\u2b07\ufe0f if your TT is visibly overheating. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If the gauge is reading low, try turning the heater on after the car has been running for a while. &nbsp;If the air coming out of the vents is not hot at all, that would be a good confirmation that the gauge is reading properly. &nbsp;Go ahead and jump to 3b\u2b07\ufe0f.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to check to see if your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=puNKAW5Nurc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sending unit has faulty wiring<\/a>, how to use a multimeter with cool\/hot water to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SGz44I90XcE\">test the sensor<\/a> (Youtube). &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If the sending unit is bad, replace it and should clear P2181. &nbsp;If not, let&#8217;s move on to step 2.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. Does the Gauge Read too Hot or too Cold?<\/h3>\n<p>Ok, now we know the temp gauge is working properly. Let&#8217;s continue diagnosing P2181 by determining if the engine is running too hot or too cold.<\/p>\n<h4>3a. Too Hot<\/h4>\n<p>If the engine is running too hot, please jump to step 4\u2b07\ufe0f.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>3b. Too Cold<\/h4>\n<p>If your TT is running too cold, it is most likely going to be <strong>the thermostat<\/strong> that is at fault. &nbsp;Replacing the thermostat is usually a pretty straightforward repair.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. &nbsp;Thermostat<\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_112473\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-112473\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-112473\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Bad-Thermostat-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"Bad Thermostat Diagnosis\" width=\"300\" height=\"325\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-112473\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A typical thermostat<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>We know from step 1, that the engine is full of coolant. &nbsp;This leaves the radiator, water pump, or thermostat. &nbsp;Since the thermostat is easiest to check, we&#8217;ll start there.<\/p>\n<p>With the engine warm (but not overheating, shut it down before that happens) squeeze the hose going to the water pump from the radiator. &nbsp;If it is limp, move down to step 6, water pump.<\/p>\n<p>If the hose is hard to squeeze, we know that there is solid water pressure. &nbsp;The thermostat may not be opening.<\/p>\n<p>Is the heater working? &nbsp;If the thermostat is all the way closed, it shouldn&#8217;t be. &nbsp;That would be enough proof that the thermostat is not opening. &nbsp;For more see the <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Audi-TT-bad-thermostat-symptoms\/\">bad thermostat diagnosis<\/a> section on this site.<\/p>\n<p>If the heat is working just fine, let&#8217;s move to step 5. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>5.

ECM<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking at your TT&#8217;s ECM, it&#8217;s likely that you have found nothing visibly wrong with the temperature sending unit, and nothing appears to be wrong with any part of the cooling system. &nbsp;It could be the ECM that is at fault, although it&#8217;s not very likely.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Before touching or considering the ECM\/PCM, you should still verify that the engine temp is correct with a temperature gun, and that the sending unit is working properly. &nbsp;At that point you&#8217;d need the PCM refreshed, which your dealer should be able to do for you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Audi TT P2181 Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Hopefully, this article helped you diagnose p2181 in your TT. &nbsp;It&#8217;s certainly not the easiest code to figure out.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>P2181 indicates that your Audi TT has an observed cooling system temperature that is too high or too low.
