While it can be tempting to throw a new camshaft position sensor in and see if it fixes the problem, the CPS doesn&#8217;t always end up fixing the problem.  Since the CPS can often be difficult to get to, testing the wiring going to it makes good sense for step one.<\/p>\n<p>Below, we&#8217;ll go over the symptoms and potential causes of P0340 in your Saturn SC.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>P0340 Symptoms:  Saturn SC<\/h2>\n<p>The CPS helps an engine determine optimal timing for combustion.  When it is not functioning properly, it can cause a lot of drivability problems in your SC<\/p>\n<p>They include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Failure to Start<\/li>\n<li>Poor Idle Quality<\/li>\n<li>Decreased Fuel Economy<\/li>\n<li>Drop in Engine Power<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Saturn SC P0340 Causes<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Saturn-SC.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Saturn-SC.png\" alt=\"P0340 Saturn SC\" width=\"248\" height=\"139\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-49089\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>As stated above, the P0340 code is often caused by a failure in the Camshaft Position Sensor itself.  Here are the most common causes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wiring Issue<\/strong>&#8211;  The Camshaft Position Sensor wiring is exposed to harsher conditions than a lot of the wiring in your SC.  It is worth looking at it to see if it has developed a <strong>short<\/strong>, or to see if the <strong>harness connector<\/strong> is loose or damaged.  Here&#8217;s a great article on how to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thoughtco.com\/car-electrical-how-to-find-a-short-circuit-4156483\">diagnose a short in a car<\/a>.  It&#8217;s really not complicated once you get the hang of it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Camshaft Position Sensor Failure<\/strong>&#8211;  After examining all of the wiring around the CPS, it&#8217;s going to be time to test the sensor itself.  Here is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RvuzZJqQDf4\">fantastic video<\/a> on how to do that with a <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2JNxlKX\">multimeter<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are significantly less likely causes for P0340 as well.  These include the PCM failing or the Crank Sensor failing.  You&#8217;ll need to check the voltage at the camshaft sensor to see if it is within spec.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>P0340 is a serious concern and should be addressed as soon as possible.  We recommend taking your SC into a mechanic as soon as possible.  If you have any suggestions for improving this article, please feel free to leave a comment below.
