&nbsp;These would include issues with the spark plugs, bad or wrong fuel, carbon deposits, and more. &nbsp;Driving around with an engine that is knocking loudly can lead to a blown engine in no time.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with engine knocking is that it can be caused by quite a few issues. &nbsp;This can make a diagnosis difficult. &nbsp;We&#8217;ve outlined some of the most common issues that would cause your SC to knock below.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Saturn-SC.png\"><img decoding=\"async\"

\/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Engine Knocking Causes: &nbsp;Saturn SC<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s never good when the engine knocks. &nbsp;Knowing the cause of the knocking will help you identify what type of repair needs to be done. <strong><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Knocking can also be caused by low oil<\/span><\/strong>. &nbsp;The FIRST thing that you should do is make sure that you aren&#8217;t running out of oil.<\/p>\n<p>Before getting into the diagnosis portion, make sure that you do an OBDII scan if the check engine light is on. &nbsp;This scan data will give you information that can help you pinpoint the problem with your SC.<\/p>\n<p>You can either purchase a scanner (they are <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2YZiIKH\">pretty cheap<\/a>) or you can go to the local parts store. &nbsp;Most of them provide this service to you at no charge.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Gas: &nbsp;Octane Issues or Bad Fuel<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes a knocking or ping sound can be caused by something as simple as using the <a href=\"https:\/\/oards.com\/signs-of-bad-fuel-inside-gas-tank\/\">wrong gas<\/a>. &nbsp;The octane rating corresponds to the amount of compression that it can take before igniting. &nbsp;Octane rating matters. &nbsp;Your engine was designed to use the type of fuel recommended by Saturn.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Spark Plugs<\/h3>\n<p>While many modern vehicles can go 100k miles with no issues at all from their spark plugs, they can still cause problems when they wear out.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_83213\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83213\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Engine-Knocking-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83213\"

miles on it. &nbsp;It&#8217;s fouled.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When the spark plugs wear out, or foul out, they are going to cause a misfire. &nbsp;This misfire will throw a code such as <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0300-Saturn-SC\/\">P0300<\/a> (random cylinder misfire). &nbsp;This code means that the cylinders are misfiring, but the misfire is occurring randomly in multiply cylinders. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There are also cylinder specific codes that correspond to which cylinder is misfiring. &nbsp;They will be P030X, where X corresponds to the cylinder that is misfiring. &nbsp;Examples: &nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/p0301-Saturn-SC\/\">P0301<\/a>, P0302, etc&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>Spark plugs are really not expensive to replace. &nbsp;Depending on the model year and engine combination in your SC, they can be easy or difficult to get to. &nbsp;It is worth noting that bad plugs have almost the exact same symptoms as <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-coil-pack-symptoms-Saturn-SC\/\">bad coil packs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This page has an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ngksparkplugs.co.za\/technical\/technical-spark-plugs\/\">awesome chart<\/a> that shows exactly what bad plugs look like and plenty of information on what might be causing the problem.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Oil Level\/Viscosity<\/h3>\n<p>If your SC is dangerously low on oil (to the point it is almost out) it could start to knock pretty bad. &nbsp;This sound is the engine starving for oil and wearing itself to death right before your ears.<\/p>\n<p>If the oil has thinned or aged so much that it can no longer lubricate the engine properly, it very well could knock. &nbsp;Thinning can happen fast if the head gasket has failed and there is coolant getting into the crankcase. &nbsp;Here are the symptoms of a<a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/Saturn-SC-blown-head-gasket\/\"> bad head gasket<\/a> for the Saturn SC.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Carbon Buildup<\/h3>\n<p>Carbon is a byproduct of the combustion process. &nbsp;As your SC&#8217;s engine ages, carbon deposits can begin to build in the combustion chamber. &nbsp;In extreme cases, this carbon buildup in the combustion chamber can lead to an increase in the effective compression ratio. &nbsp;This can and will cause the engine to knock. Modern gasoline has additives that clean these deposits as you go. &nbsp;But, it is still known to happen.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion: &nbsp;SC Knocking Engine Diagnosis<\/h2>\n<p>Good luck diagnosing the knocking sound coming from your engine. &nbsp;If there is anything that you would like to add, please leave a comment below. &nbsp;Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; There are many different things that can cause engine knocking in your Saturn SC. &nbsp;These would include issues with the spark plugs, bad or wrong fuel, carbon deposits, and more. &nbsp;Driving around with an engine that is knocking loudly can lead to a blown engine in no time.
