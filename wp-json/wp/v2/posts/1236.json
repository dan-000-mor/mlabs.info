\u00a0Even more improvements over the 4L65E.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Gearing<\/h2>\n<p>Both transmissions use the same exact gear ratios with a final overdrive of .7:1, which is a 30% overdrive. \u00a0This makes either of them a fantastic replacement for the TH350 and TH400 transmissions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>700r4 and 4L60E\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Gear Ratios: \u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>First- 3.06<\/li>\n<li>Second- 1.62<\/li>\n<li>Third- 1.00<\/li>\n<li>Fourth- 0.70<\/li>\n<li>Reverse-2.29<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>700R4 and 4L60E Differences<\/h2>\n<p>The biggest difference between these two transmissions is going to be the way that they are controlled. \u00a0They identical in terms of length and where they bolt to the crossmember. \u00a0The problem is that the 700R4 is controlled by the TV cable, which is basically just a basic throttle position sensor. \u00a0The 4L60E, on the other hand, is controlled by computer. \u00a0If you bolt it to a vehicle that is not computer controlled, it won&#8217;t know when to shift.<\/p>\n<p>While they are physically similar, the 4L60 and 4L60E have many design improvements over the 700R4. \u00a0The original 4L60E that GM started using in the early nineties looked exactly like the 700R4. \u00a0They both used a one piece case. \u00a0The 4L60E eventually adopted a two piece case. \u00a0This let GM add different bellhousings to it easily, creating a more adaptable transmission.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Identification<\/h2>\n<p>It is possible to confuse an early 4L60E with a 700R4, since they use the same transmission pan and are virtually identical on the outside. \u00a0By 1996 though, GM began moving to the two piece case that they use for their transmissions to this day. \u00a0So realistically, if you are looking to tell if it&#8217;s a 4L60E or 700R4 it&#8217;ll only be difficult for the extremely early ones. \u00a0There are two in depth articles on this site that can help you identify these transmissions down to the year.<\/p>\n<p>Here they are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/4l60e-identification\/\">4L60E Identification\u00a0<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/identifying-a-700r4\/\">700R4 Identification<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the only thing you are looking for is to tell them apart, use the info below. \u00a0There are two primary ways of telling them apart:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rpocodes.com\/GM-RPO-codes\/gmrpocodesGthroughM.html\">RPO Codes<\/a>&#8211; \u00a0The 700R4 will be stamped with the code MD8, while the 4L60E will have the code <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/m30-transmission\/\">M30<\/a> on it. \u00a0If the transmission is still in the vehicle, check for the code label and you&#8217;ll find the stamp on there to tell you what transmission is actually in the car. \u00a0You&#8217;ll just look for one of these two codes on it.\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1085\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1085\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/4L70E-Transmission-Connector.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1085 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/4L70E-Transmission-Connector-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"4L60E vs 700R4\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/4L70E-Transmission-Connector-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/4L70E-Transmission-Connector-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/4L70E-Transmission-Connector-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/4L70E-Transmission-Connector-100x75.jpg 100w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/4L70E-Transmission-Connector-150x113.jpg 150w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/4L70E-Transmission-Connector-200x150.jpg 200w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/4L70E-Transmission-Connector-450x338.jpg 450w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/4L70E-Transmission-Connector-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/4L70E-Transmission-Connector-900x675.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1085\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Look for a big electronic plug on a 4L60E.

You should still try and find the transmission that was originally intended for your vehicle, since some are made to handle more power or different engines. \u00a0Of course you could just go aftermarket and not have to worry about that at all.<\/p>\n<h2>Swapping<\/h2>\n<p>When swapping one of these transmission for each other, far and away the most difficult obstacle that you are going to face is how the transmission itself is controlled. \u00a0With that in mind, from a cost perspective the 700R4 is cheaper to put in place of the 4L60E than vice versa. \u00a0There&#8217;s a lot of good info about it in the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/ls-engine-swap-transmission-guide\/\">LS swap transmission guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Really, it&#8217;s better if you have a motor that already has a 4L60E to keep it, or vice versa. \u00a0The only time that it might be worth doing is when you are doing a motor swap, and the transmission is still in the car. \u00a0You&#8217;ll need adapters to make any of this work. \u00a0For more see the <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/ls-engine-swap-transmission-guide\/\">LS swap<\/a> guide.<\/p>\n<h3>700R4 to 4L60E Swap<\/h3>\n<p>Swapping a 700R4 out for a 4L60E is going to require an independent transmission control unit. \u00a0They cost a couple hundred bucks. \u00a0You than program some information about your vehicle into the unit, add a throttle position sensor, and you are off to the races with your 4L60E.<\/p>\n<h3>4L60E to 700R4 Swaping<\/h3>\n<p>Putting a 700R4 behind an LS series motor is a popular swap option. \u00a0You&#8217;ll find that you need to find a bracket to bolt the tv cable to. \u00a0Some people put it on the gas pedal. \u00a0There are some aftermarket kits available depending on the vehicle. \u00a0After that the ECM will need to be tuned to not care about the transmission, or I&#8217;ve heard there can be stalling issues. \u00a0If you are going to put a 700R4 where an LS engine was, you&#8217;ll need to buy a spacer so that the torque converter will engage properly.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>700R4 versus 4L60E strength<\/h2>\n<p>These transmissions had a 25 year production life between the two of them. \u00a0As far as which one is stronger from the factory, the 4L60E is stronger. \u00a0They improved as time went on. \u00a0So, it&#8217;s better to get a later 4L60E than an early one. \u00a0The same holds true for the 700R4. \u00a0Examples from the early nineties are much stronger than ones from the 80&#8217;s. \u00a0If you end up buying either one from the aftermarket, it won&#8217;t matter at all. \u00a0They will be plenty strong. \u00a0All of the kinks have been worked out for quite some time.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Naming Confusion<\/h2>\n<p>The naming of these transmission causes quite a bit of the confusion people have with these transmissions. \u00a0A lot of people are confused by the 4L60 name. \u00a0The 4L60 is the 700R4, just a later model. \u00a0GM switched the transmission naming nomenclature to a more standardized format during the 700R4&#8217;s life.<\/p>\n<p>So the 4L60 means:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>4 forward gears<\/li>\n<li>Longitudinal drive (rear wheel)<\/li>\n<li>60 is a representation of the torque it&#8217;s supposed to handle<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The E in 4L60E is for &#8220;electronic&#8221;, which signifies the transmissions need to speak with a computer to work.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>You may also like:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/4l60e-vs-4l80e-differences\/\">4L60E VS 4L80E Differences\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/4l60e-transmission-problems\/\">4L60E Transmission Problems<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/gm-automatic-transmissions\/4l60e-identification\/\">4L60E Identification<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The 700R4 and 4L60E transmission are not siblings. \u00a0It is better to think of them as the continuation of the same design. \u00a0From the early eighties until quite recently it has been in service in GM passenger vehicles and light trucks. \u00a0Throughout that whole period, they have constantly improved.
