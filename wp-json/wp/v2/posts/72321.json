This is especially true if the mixture ends up too lean.<\/p>\n<p>While a rough running engine can be a sign of a bad oxygen sensor, it is often a sign of a misfire as well.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Failed Emissions<\/h3>\n<p>Often enough, there won&#8217;t be any noticeable signs of a bad oxygen sensor. &nbsp;You&#8217;ll go to get an emissions check done, and your Focus fails the test. &nbsp;Without a check engine light, it can be tough to lock down exactly what would cause the vehicle to fail, but oxygen sensors are one of the more common causes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Focus Bad O2 Sensor Symptoms &amp; Causes: &nbsp;Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>There may or may not be any noticeable symptoms when your Ford Focus&#8217;s oxygen sensor(s) go bad. &nbsp;It is smart to use a scan tool to determine whether or not there is an OBDII trouble code associated with any of the sensors. &nbsp;Good luck diagnosing your Focus!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Oxygen sensors play a vital role in both engine management and emissions control. &nbsp;When an O2 (oxygen) sensor go bad, it&#8217;ll cause your Ford Focus&#8216;s engine to run less efficiently.
