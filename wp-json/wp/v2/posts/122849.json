Check The Serpentine Belt<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Serpentine-Belt.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Serpentine-Belt.jpg\" alt=\"Battery Light Causes Borrego\" class=\"wp-image-181411\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Serpentine-Belt.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Serpentine-Belt-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before testing your Borrego\u2019s battery, examine the basic things.&nbsp; The serpentine belt that turns the alternator is top of the list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the alternator.&nbsp; Is the belt missing?&nbsp; Is it shiny and cracked?&nbsp; If it is missing entirely, don\u2019t drive your Borrego for any reason until you replace it.&nbsp; If it\u2019s shiny and cracked, it may not be turning the alternator fast enough to charge the battery, even if it is there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the engine running, take a look at the serpentine belt.&nbsp; If it appears wobbly or is making a squeaking sound, replace it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Clean any Battery Post Corrosion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Corroded-Battery.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Corroded-Battery.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-211083\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Corroded-Battery.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Corroded-Battery-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Corroded-Battery-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><figcaption>If you have a battery post that looks like this, clean it.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, examine the battery posts.&nbsp; If they have a battery acid buildup, you may fix your Borrego\u2019s alternator warning light by cleaning them and the battery terminals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The voltage from the alternator goes to the battery through a wire that connects it to the battery post.&nbsp; If the battery post is corroded, it won&#8217;t be able to do its job of sending the voltage to and from the battery efficiently, and your Borrego&#8217;s battery light will turn on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It only takes a second to check the battery posts out.&nbsp; A battery post cleaner or wire brush can clean them in no time.&nbsp; Just be careful not to get any of the corrosion in your eye.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Battery post cleaner is available at most parts stores.&nbsp; You can also mix a generous amount of baking soda in water to clean the terminals.&nbsp; Let it sit in the mixture for about 10 minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Bad Ground Wire<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Ground-Wire.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Ground-Wire.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-274722\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Ground-Wire.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Ground-Wire-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Above, we discussed that a bad ground connection at the battery could cause the lights to flicker and a no-start condition. But, a damaged or loose ground connection can cause the problem anywhere on the cable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspect your Borrego&#8217;s ground cable for any obvious damage. Then, follow it to its mounting location on the engine block or chassis. Make sure that it is snugged tightly and that there&#8217;s no rust underneath it. This is a very common reason why <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/kia-borrego-dash-light-flicker-will-not-start\/\">dash lights flicker\/no start<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Test the Alternator<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Alternator-Symptoms.jpeg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Bad-Alternator-Symptoms-916x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"Battery Light Diagnosis Kia Borrego\" class=\"wp-image-74394\" width=\"250\" height=\"278\"\/><\/a><figcaption>A typical alternator<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a multimeter, you can test your Borrego\u2019s alternator at home in no time.&nbsp; It\u2019s super easy:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Set the multimeter to read voltage. Specifically, you\u2019ll need to set it to 20V DC.<\/li><li>With your Borrego turned off, you\u2019ll connect the negative side of the meter to the negative battery post.&nbsp; Touch the positive side of the voltmeter to the positive battery wire.&nbsp; With the engine off, you should get a reading somewhere between 12.0 volts and 12.6 volts.<\/li><li>Now that you have a baseline, it\u2019s time to turn the engine on.&nbsp; Leave the air conditioner off, as well as the headlights and any other accessories.<\/li><li>After firing the engine up, you should get over 14.2 volts.&nbsp; If you got 14.2 or more volts, the alternator is charging fine.&nbsp; If it\u2019s still showing in the 12\u2019s, it\u2019s time to replace the alternator.&nbsp; If it\u2019s producing a voltage level in the 13s, go ahead and take it into a parts store and have it tested.&nbsp; It\u2019s probably faulty.<\/li><li>Assuming that the alternator was producing over 14 volts, go ahead and turn on the headlights, air conditioner, radio, and any other accessory you can think of, and run the same test again.&nbsp; If the voltage dropped back into the 12s, it\u2019s a very strong indication that your Borrego&#8217;s alternator needs replacing.&nbsp; It\u2019s still worth having it tested, but be prepared to replace it.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How to Test a Car Battery with a Multimeter\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/COJr7OB23Hw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>An alternator that\u2019s not putting out enough voltage will usually make itself known when the engine is running.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you see your Borrego&#8217;s battery light turn on while driving, it\u2019s likely the alternator is no longer providing enough voltage to power the various electrical systems and charge the battery simultaneously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Can You Drive Your Borrego With a Faulty Alternator?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not a good idea to drive with a bad alternator. If you must, there are things you can do to prolong how long the vehicle will last before the battery dies:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Turn off the climate control<\/li><li>Turn off the radio<\/li><li>Don&#8217;t use the auto-start feature<\/li><li>No headlights. If you have to drive at night, it&#8217;ll drain the battery fast<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, anything you can turn off is going to prolong how far your Kia Borrego can go with just the battery. It&#8217;ll probably sputter and misfire a bit before the engine gives out entirely. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Test the Battery<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the battery light stays on but doesn\u2019t turn back on after running the engine for a few minutes and then starting back up, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll need to replace your Borrego\u2019s battery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/vehicle-battery.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/vehicle-battery.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-177891\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/vehicle-battery.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/vehicle-battery-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If the battery posts are clean, and you had over 14 volts on your multimeter with the engine idling under full accessory load, but the voltage drops below 12 volts when you shut your Borrego off, it\u2019s likely the battery is bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can take it to a parts store and have it tested and replaced free of charge.&nbsp; It\u2019s a great way to get you to buy a battery from them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Borrego can run off the alternator just fine once it&#8217;s started.&nbsp; This is an important thing to know.&nbsp; A dead battery usually makes itself known when you are trying to start the vehicle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Resetting the Battery Light<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You shouldn&#8217;t have to do anything to reset your Borrego&#8217;s battery light<\/strong>. It should take care of itself as you fix the problem. Sometimes, it&#8217;ll stay on if the voltage level was too low when starting the vehicle. In that case, it should turn off on the next start (if the problem was fixed)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion:&nbsp; Kia Borrego Battery Light<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jumping straight to battery replacement will often fix your Borrego\u2019s battery warning light, but taking a look at the charging system first can save you a lot of money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Borrego will operate for a short period of time off of the battery alone.&nbsp; But, if the alternator has gone bad, it will eventually leave you stranded.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your battery light comes on on the road, get somewhere to have it tested as soon as possible.&nbsp; Operate under the assumption that you will be stranded.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If your Kia Borrego&#8217;s battery light is on, it is trying to warn you that there is an issue with the charging system.
