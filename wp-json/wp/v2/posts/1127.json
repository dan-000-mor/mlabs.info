Over tightening is just as bad as under tightening a bolt in many cases, espescially if you are re-assembling a motor. &nbsp;Hopefully if you find yourself with the need for a torque wrench, this buying guide will help you find the right wrench.<\/p>\n<p>Back in the day, a car was made mainly of steel and iron.&nbsp; If you over torqued something the car would be a little more forgiving.&nbsp; Today\u2019s cars are made of steel, iron, plastic, and aluminum.&nbsp; These new materials strip out with ease.&nbsp; Having a good torque wrench is an indispensable part of your tool box now more than ever.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Borrowing Instead of Buying<\/h2>\n<p>If you think that you&#8217;ll rarely use a torque wrench, many auto parts stores offer a loan a tool program.&nbsp; You can borrow a great torque wrench for a day or two.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll usually need to leave a deposit equal in value to the tool, but will receive the whole deposit back when you return the tool in the condition you found it in.&nbsp; This is a great way to go if you can only see yourself using it once every few years.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s the page for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autozone.com\/landing\/page.jsp?name=loan-a-tool\">Autozone&#8217;s loan a tool<\/a> program.&nbsp; Check it out.&nbsp; It can save you some money.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Different Types of Torque Wrench<\/h2>\n<p>There are two major ways to distinguish torque wrenches.&nbsp; They will be any combination of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Indicator Type<\/strong>: This may be click, beam, or electronic.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Drive Type<\/strong>: The size of part of the torque wrench that accepts the socket.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Indicator Types<\/h2>\n<p>There are really three main types of torque wrench.&nbsp; They are distinguished by the way that you set the desired torque and how they let you know you&#8217;ve tightened the bolt enough.<\/p>\n<p>The first type is the one that most people think of when they think torque wrench.&nbsp; That is the <strong>click type<\/strong>.&nbsp; The<strong> beam type<\/strong>&nbsp;is simple and used to be more popular.&nbsp; The <strong>electronic torque wrench<\/strong> is relatively new and super accurate.&nbsp; We will go into depth on each below.<\/p>\n<p>In the United States, torque is generally measured by LB. Pounds.&nbsp; A lot of the world uses the Metric standard Newton Meter.&nbsp; Always make sure your wrench has both.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Click Type&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This type of wrench gives a satisfying click when the pre determined level of torque has been achieved.&nbsp; These wrenches usually have a higher max torque rating than the beam style.<\/p>\n<p>Although during low torque situations, the click may be hard to hear.&nbsp; This type of torque wrench also has a ratcheting action to it, which is a huge convenience over having to pull the socket off of the bolt every time you need to reset.<\/p>\n<p>Click type torque wrenches typically have a handle that will turn a torque level indicator.&nbsp; This will change what level of torque that activates the click.&nbsp; For most people we recommend this type of wrench.&nbsp; It is hard to over torque something when you are looking to feel a click.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Beam Type<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Beam torque wrenches are simple in design and effective.&nbsp; They use a dial indicator that looks almost like a volt gauge to indicated the torque level.&nbsp; The main disadvantage to this type of indicator is that you must be observing the wrench itself in order to get a proper reading.<\/p>\n<p>The beam type torque wrench may be for you if you are going to be using it casually, maybe a couple of times a year.&nbsp; In order to get the most out of the beam torque wrench, you really need to be able to <em>gradually<\/em> apply pressure to the wrench so that the torque gauge rises slowly and consistently.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Electronic<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The electronic torque wrench works in the same basically the same as the click type version.&nbsp; The main differences are that you\u2019ll hear an audible beep instead of a click when you tighten the bolt enough.a<\/p>\n<p>This type of torque wrench is fantastic for professional mechanics and engine builders.&nbsp; Electronic torque wrenches have memory features that allow you to see the max torque that was applied to it, as well as a record of previous torques in case you need to go back and look at them for some reason.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Using a Torque Wrench<\/h2>\n<p>Using a torque wrench is about as easy as selecting the amount of torque you wish to apply and tightening the bolt. &nbsp;Torque wrenches are a bit more unwieldy than their ratchet counterparts, so it&#8217;s a good idea to go ahead and snug any bolt that you are preparing to torque.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t use the torque wrench as a ratchet. &nbsp;They are precision instruments and will wear out prematurely under a heavy load. &nbsp;Some torque wrenches have the ability to loosen a nut. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t use them for that. &nbsp;Get a good <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2zoy6Ei\">breaker bar<\/a> instead.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like to know all about the proper operation of a click type torque wrench, here is a great video that does just that:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/3v3hLvuO_KU?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Drive Types<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There are four drive types that torque wrenches are available in.&nbsp; They are 1\/4, 3\/8, 1\/2, and 3\/4 of an inch.&nbsp; These sizes correspond to the socket input size, the same as any normal ratchet would accept.&nbsp; Although if you are going to be doing a lot of high torque wrenching, it may be advisable to pick up a good set of <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2hmVdYr\">impact sockets<\/a>.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t want to break a socket off in an engine and have to deal with the extra metal going somewhere that it shouldn&#8217;t go.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00bc\u201d Drive-<\/strong>&nbsp; These wrenches usually have an indicator in inch pounds and not foot pounds.&nbsp; They really should be considered a specialty tool, and not the size you should get if you are looking to get only one torque wrench.&nbsp; Most of the time, these wrenches call for torque in inch pounds and not foot pounds.&nbsp; Typically these wrenches will only tell you torque to a maximum of 20 foot pounds before they have reached the end of their useful range.&nbsp; You may find a need for these when working with bolts that need torqued into plastic or aluminum.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>3\/8\u201d Drive<\/strong>&#8211;&nbsp; This correlates to the most common ratchet size.&nbsp; The typical torque wrench in this size is going to fit anywhere that you would want to fit it and max out around 70-80 lb. pounds.&nbsp; That makes them great for almost all of the torque needs that you may encounter.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00bd\u201d Drive<\/strong>&#8211;&nbsp; This is going to be the size that most people think of when they think torque wrench.&nbsp; These wrenches can torque up to 250 pounds before they run out of gas, which means they will work for nearly any thing that will come your way.&nbsp; If you are looking to get one size of torque wrench, this is the size that we recommend.&nbsp; This is the only size that will handle all the torque needs of most engine assemblies.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00be\u201d Drive<\/strong>&#8211;&nbsp; Are you a dump truck mechanic?&nbsp; Awesome!!&nbsp; That\u2019s about the only person who is going to need this thing!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Best 1\/2&#8243; Click Type Torque Wrench Picks<\/h2>\n<p>We recommend purchasing a click type torque wrench. &nbsp;They are easier to use than a beam type and you don&#8217;t have to question whether or not you&#8217;ve torqued the bolt enough. &nbsp;This will keep you from over tightening.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>TEKTON 2430 1\/2&#8243;
