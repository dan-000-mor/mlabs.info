You&#8217;ll find a couple of different wiring situations down there. &nbsp;The first one that there is a combined switch down there that controls the cruise control, brake lights, and lockup converter.<\/p>\n<p>The switch will be hot unless you press the pedal in, which is the exact opposite of how a brake light switch works, so it&#8217;ll do you no good to try and splice into your brake pedal wiring to fix this. &nbsp;This is so if it goes out the torque converter doesn&#8217;t stay locked up, which would be way bigger of a problem.<\/p>\n<p>If there is more than one switch down there, than you&#8217;ll want to either google your make and model and figure out which one it is. &nbsp;Or, you can <strong>unplug one and see when if your brake lights still work<\/strong>. &nbsp;If the lights still work than you know you&#8217;ve found your switch.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the time the&nbsp;cruise control switch will do double duty with the torque converter lockup switch, so using process of elimination above that should get you to the part you need.<\/p>\n<p>Now you may &nbsp;want to make sure that the circuit is getting voltage. &nbsp;You can do that with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000M5ZWBA\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B000M5ZWBA&amp;linkId=c813691315155699b932a9e82cdb211f\">test light.<\/a>&nbsp; If it&#8217;s not, you&#8217;ll need to make sure that you have checked that the fuse hasn&#8217;t gone out, or you&#8217;ve singed a wire. &nbsp;This can often happen after you&#8217;ve installed an aftermarket stereo system. &nbsp;All of these suggestions should cost you less than twenty bucks, and more than likely will be able to fix this problem.<\/p>\n<h3>700R4 not shifting right<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/700r4-tv-cable.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-689\" src=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/700r4-tv-cable.jpg\" alt=\"700R4 Problem Diagnosis\" width=\"396\" height=\"282\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/700r4-tv-cable.jpg 396w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/700r4-tv-cable-300x214.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/700r4-tv-cable-100x71.jpg 100w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/700r4-tv-cable-150x107.jpg 150w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/700r4-tv-cable-200x142.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The 700R4 is still a mechanically controlled transmission (with the exception of the locking converter circuit mentioned above), and depends physical pressure sensors and a sort of throttle position sensor to get it&#8217;s throttle position right. &nbsp;This throttle position sensor is called the &#8220;TV Cable&#8221; &nbsp;This cable acts like the kick down switch would on a TH350 in that it&#8217;s physical, but lets the transmission know exactly where the throttle position is like a 4L60E. &nbsp;If you think that your TV cable may be going out, you can pick one up on Amazon for under thirty bucks here: &nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2kTO8lF\">http:\/\/amzn.to\/2kTO8lF<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here is a good video on how to install and adjust a TV Cable:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/D109Fz1SK18\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>700R4 speedometer not working<\/h3>\n<p>The 700R4 uses both a traditional mechanical speedometer cable, like you might find in an older muscle car. &nbsp;Alternatively, they also used a variable speed sensor. &nbsp;This sensor is often abbreviated &#8220;VSS&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Common causes:<\/p>\n<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll need to know is which type of speed sensor you have. &nbsp;If you can safely get under the car and take a look around the tail-shaft. &nbsp;If the cable coming out of it is thick with a big circle that screws into it, you have a mechanical speedometer.<\/p>\n<p>Try<strong> replacing the speedometer cable<\/strong>. &nbsp;Unless the speedometer itself is broken, this will most likely fix it.<\/p>\n<p>If there is a wiring harness that plugs into something back there, you have a VSS. &nbsp;You&#8217;ll need to determine if the wiring is getting voltage. &nbsp;If it is you&#8217;ll need to replace the VSS on the tail shaft, or the speedometer itself. &nbsp;Of course, you could get lucky and it&#8217;ll just be a wiring issue.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Engine revs, but&nbsp;the car hardly moves<\/h3>\n<p>This is either low transmission fluid or a problem that is going to get end with you at the transmission shop, and no more college savings for your kids. &nbsp;Have you noticed the transmission puking fluid when you park it?
