This limited power is a failsafe to keep the vehicle able to move, but not super fast. Since the ECM won&#8217;t really know how much throttle response is actually happening when you push the gas.<\/li>\n<li>The vehicle&#8217;s ECM will control the amount of fuel entering the engine in order to control engine speed.<\/li>\n<li>The Escape may idle differently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Failsafe mode leaves a vehicle in a state that makes it almost impossible to drive and enjoy.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>P0121 Causes- Escape<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0121-Diagnosis.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4144 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0121-Diagnosis-300x74.png\" alt=\"P0121 Diagnosis Ford Escape\" width=\"300\" height=\"74\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0121-Diagnosis-300x74.png 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0121-Diagnosis-100x25.png 100w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0121-Diagnosis-150x37.png 150w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0121-Diagnosis-200x50.png 200w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0121-Diagnosis-450x112.png 450w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/P0121-Diagnosis.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the Ford Escape, the P0121 is going to be caused by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A discrepancy between the voltage reading from TPS sensor circuit &#8220;A&#8221; and TPS circuit &#8220;B&#8221; where TPS circuit &#8220;A&#8221; is higher than the specified voltage range by more than 1.6 volts.<\/li>\n<li>A discrepancy between the voltage reading from TPS sensor circuit &#8220;A&#8221; and TPS circuit &#8220;B&#8221; where TPS circuit &#8220;A&#8221; is lower than the specified voltage range by more than 0.8 volts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In normal English, the two TPS circuits can&#8217;t agree on how far the gas pedal has been pushed down.
