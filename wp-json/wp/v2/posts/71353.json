This is always most noticeable at idle speed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Loss of Power<\/strong>&#8211; A blown head gasket can leave your Q8 feeling sluggish at speed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>&#8220;Milky&#8221; Oil<\/strong>&#8211; Depending on how bad and where the head gasket has broken, engine coolant can mix with the oil. This is a very serious concern. Oil that is too this can lock the motor up and leave you stranded.<\/li>\n<li><strong>White Smoke from Exhaust<\/strong>&#8211; A certain amount of white smoke is completely acceptable. But, if you feel that it has greatly changed recently don&#8217;t ignore it. &nbsp;Related: &nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/white-smoke-from-exhaust-Audi-Q8\/\">White Exhaust Smoke Diagnosis: Audi Q8<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Loss of Coolant<\/strong>&#8211; If your Q8&#8217;s engine coolant level is going down, but there is no noticeable leak, it could be a sign that the head gasket has blown.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"causes\">Audi Q8 Blown Head Gasket Causes<\/h2>\n<p>While there are many reasons that your Q8&#8217;s head gasket can fail, the most common ones have to do with the cooling system causing the engine to overheat. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Low Engine Coolant<\/strong>&#8211; If there is not enough coolant to properly cool the engine, it&#8217;ll overheat and blow the head gasket. Low engine coolant can be both the cause and a symptom of a blown head gasket.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bad Thermostat<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;The thermostats job is to regulate the flow of coolant in and out of your Q8&#8217;s engine. &nbsp;When it refuses to open, the engine can get hot enough that it&#8217;ll crack a head or blow a head gasket.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Poor Coolant Flow<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;If there is not enough coolant flowing through the engine, it&#8217;ll overheat. &nbsp;This could be due to a bad radiator, radiator hoses, or water pump. &nbsp;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Head Gasket Failure<\/strong>&#8211; &nbsp;It&#8217;s not uncommon for some vehicle makes and models to have head gaskets that just fail for no other reason than bad engineering.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"cost\">Q8 Head Gasket Repair Cost<\/h2>\n<p>Head gaskets themselves are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=Audi+Q8+head+gasket&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=fa317fc9976b5f3453195e8c685fb551&amp;language=en_US\">very affordable<\/a>. It&#8217;s the <strong>labor<\/strong> involved with getting them replaced that will get you.<\/p>\n<p>With engines that have overhead cams, it&#8217;s can be an incredibly arduous task. It&#8217;s a bit easier with traditional engines that have the camshaft in the block.<\/p>\n<p>With parts and labor, the average head gasket price is north of $1200. They can be significantly more depending on the model year and engine. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you plan on tackling the job yourself, start at the beginning of the weekend, and make sure that you use a <a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/torque-wrench-buying-guide\/\">torque wrench<\/a> when putting everything together.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Replacing a head gasket on your own can be time consuming and challenging, but it can save you a lot of money. &nbsp;If there is anything that you&#8217;d like to add, please feel free to leave a comment below. &nbsp;Good luck diagnosing your Audi Q8!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; One of the most common critical engine problems is the blown head gasket.
