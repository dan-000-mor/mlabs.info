Worn Clutch Disc<\/h3>\n<p>Think of your clutch like a giant brake pad.&nbsp; While it is very likely that it will outlast a set of normal brake pads, it still does wear down.&nbsp; When it wears all the way down to there is no friction surface left.&nbsp; At this point, the clutch can no longer grip the flywheel properly, even though it still has pressure put on it from the pressure plate.<\/p>\n<p>The friction material wearing down is far and away the most common reason that a clutch slips.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. Oil or Grease<\/h3>\n<p>If there is oil or grease that is leaking from your Orlando&#8217;s engine or transmission, it can cause the clutch to slip.&nbsp; Unlike a clutch disc that has worn out, an oily or greasy disc will usually grab again without you letting off the throttle (the slipping burns it up).<\/p>\n<p>Oil on your clutch disc is likely to be caused by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Engine that is leaking oil<\/li>\n<li>Transmission leak<\/li>\n<li>Leak in the clutch lines or clutch slave cylinder<\/li>\n<li>Too much grease put on the pilot bearing or input shaft during installation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. Clutch Disc Not Making Full Contact<\/h3>\n<p>This can happen when you replace the clutch but not the flywheel (or you don&#8217;t have the flywheel resurfaced).&nbsp; The clutch disc will only cover a fraction of the available flywheel surface, and it won&#8217;t be enough to handle a high amount of torque.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. Overheating<\/h3>\n<p>If the clutch disc overheats, it can slip.&nbsp; This can happen when you have to slip the disc constantly (think traffic jam).&nbsp; When this happens it can do a lot of damage to the clutch and pressure plate.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>New Clutch Slipping<\/h2>\n<p>A new clutch can slip for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; The most common one is that the old flywheel was reused.&nbsp; It can also be due to a fault in the release system.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>We hope this article helps you better understand how and why your Orlando&#8217;s clutch may be slipping.&nbsp; If you can leave anything to help the next person diagnose their vehicle, please leave a comment below.&nbsp; Thanks!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your Chevy Orlando&#8217;s clutch provides a direct connection between the engine and transmission.&nbsp; Without it, it can&#8217;t move at all.
