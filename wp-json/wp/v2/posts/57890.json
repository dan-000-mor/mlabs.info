Here is a list of common potential causes for P0160 in general:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wiring<\/strong>&#8211; You&#8217;ll want to visually inspect the harness where it plugs into the O2 sensor. Make sure that the pins look good and that the harness is seating well and not cracked. Also check to make sure that the wiring is not frayed or shorted. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M4LGykZiRtY\">How to check for a short (YouTube)<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bad O2 Sensor<\/strong>&#8211; The oxygen sensor itself can go bad. This is often the cause of P0160. Replacing it without testing the wiring going to\/from it first is a gamble that will often pay off, but it&#8217;s still a good idea to check your harness connections and inspect it first. &nbsp;If you do conclude that the O2 sensor has gone bad, they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=aps&amp;field-keywords=oxygen+sensor+Toyota+FJ Cruiser&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=700r4hq-20&amp;linkId=cd06fe8e3c754ca50b5ebe626edbb447&amp;language=en_US\">aren&#8217;t that expensive<\/a> to replace.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Exhaust Leak<\/strong>&#8211; An exhaust will can cause P0160. You should be able to listen and find it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bad Heated O2 Circuit<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The wiring harness often goes bad with the 02 sensor by the catalytic converter. &nbsp;The extreme heat from the exhaust can really damage a wiring harness, espescially the connection.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>There are a lot of issues that can cause P0160 in the Toyota FJ Cruiser. Most of the time, it&#8217;ll be the O2 sensor or the wiring to it.
