\u00a0The TH350 is controlled by engine vacuum and a kick down cable. \u00a0The 700R4 on the other hand is controlled by a <a href=\"http:\/\/mlabs.info\/parts\/2004r-700r4\/tv-cable\/\">TV cable<\/a>. \u00a0The best way to think of the TV cable is as a throttle position sensor. \u00a0It controls shifts based on how much throttle is being given at any time. \u00a0It is easy to swap transmission control to a TV cable if you are thinking about swapping to a 700R4. \u00a0There is more info on what needs to be done in the TV cable article a few sentences back.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Overdrive<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0The TH350 has three forward gears and no overdrive. \u00a0The 700R4 uses an overdrive gear to reduce engine RPM at highway speed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are many other differences between the two transmissions that are noteworthy as well. \u00a0This is a broad take on these differences.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Locking Torque Converter<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0The 700R4 has a locking torque converter, which means that a clutch will engage at a high enough speed and allow for a true direct connection between the engine and transmission. \u00a0This increases fuel economy and slightly lowers RPM going down the road. \u00a0You have to set up wiring to make it work in a car that it was never equipped with. \u00a0A car with originally equipped with a TH350 is not going to have the wiring for that built-in.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Length<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0The TH350 is a shorter than the 700R4, so if you were going to swap one for the other, you&#8217;d need to have your driveshaft resized or replaced.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Gear Ratios<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0The TH350&#8217;s gears are placed closer together (despite having less of them). \u00a0While a vehicle with 4.11 gearing may scream down the highway with a a TH350, it&#8217;s going to keep the engine in the power band longer. \u00a0The 700R4\u00a0goes from a 3.06 -&gt; 1.62 1-2 shift, which is way more aggressive than the Turbo 350&#8217;s 2.74 -&gt; 1.57. \u00a0Simply put, the TH350 is going to keep the vehicle in the power band longer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>TH350 vs 700R4 Gearing<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1st<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2nd<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3rd<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4th<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reverse<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>700R4<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.06<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.62<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.0<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0.70<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.29<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>TH350<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.52<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.52<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.00<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">N\/A<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.92<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>700R4 vs TH350: \u00a0Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>There are really two major determining factors regarding which transmission is best for you.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is overdrive worth to you?<\/li>\n<li>Do you want to race or be steerable?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Almost every modern car has an overdrive transmission. \u00a0If you didn&#8217;t grow up in the time when a TH350 equipped car would be in your daily driver, you may not remember the engine screaming down the highway. \u00a0It is not as fun as it sounds.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s much nicer to listen to the engine hum\u00a0down the highway in overdrive sipping, not guzzling, the gas. \u00a0Unless you really want to do hardcore racing, you should take a look at the 700R4.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The TH350 was GM&#8217;s go to transmission for light duty vehicles from the late sixties through the early eighties, that is until the 700R4 and 200-4R began to replace it. \u00a0When comparing the TH350 vs the 700R4, there are quite a few differences. \u00a0The biggest one is going to be overdrive.
