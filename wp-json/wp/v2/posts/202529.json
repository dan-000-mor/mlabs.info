Check Engine Light<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-202531 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Service-Engine-Soon.jpg\" alt=\"Check Engine Bad Knock Sensor\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Service-Engine-Soon.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Service-Engine-Soon-300x150.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A bad knock sensor will trigger the check engine light. &nbsp;Any trouble codes from P0325-P0334 are related to the knock sensor in one way or the other.<\/p>\n<p>The code you get will either be for an intermittent problem, high input, low input, or open circuit.&nbsp; Regardless of what the code&#8217;s definition is, most of the time, it&#8217;s going to mean that there is an issue with the wiring harness, or the sensor in question is bad.<\/p>\n<p>Some vehicles also have more than one knock sensor. So if you do have a code, it&#8217;ll tell you which one it is.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>2. Loss of Fuel Mileage<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-202532 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Empty-Gas-Gauge.jpg\" alt=\"Bad Knock Sensor Symptoms\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Empty-Gas-Gauge.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Empty-Gas-Gauge-300x150.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Everything about a modern engine is designed for optimum combustion. &nbsp;Optimum combustion gets your vehicle the best fuel mileage that the engine can manage.<\/p>\n<p>The PCM uses the data from the knock sensors to determine if the timing has been too far advanced.&nbsp; If it is, it&#8217;ll back the timing down.&nbsp; This keeps the engine safe from detonation but decreases fuel mileage.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>3. Lack of Power<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-202533 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Gas-Pedal.jpg\" alt=\"Bad Knock Sensor Fix\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Gas-Pedal.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Gas-Pedal-300x150.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As mentioned above, with the timing backed off, there may be a noticeable lack of engine power. &nbsp;It shouldn&#8217;t misfire. &nbsp;But, there may be a noticeable lack of power. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Some vehicles rely on the knock sensor more than others.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll notice the lack of power the most on engines that are turbocharged or have high compression.&nbsp; Whereas in some naturally aspirated, lower compression engines, you might not even be able to tell the difference.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>4. Increased Emissions<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-202534 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Tail-Pipe.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Tail-Pipe.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Tail-Pipe-300x150.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Vehicle emissions increase whenever the engine timing is not optimal. &nbsp;You may encounter trouble codes relating to emissions when your knock sensor is not working properly.&nbsp; Deal with the knock sensor(s) first.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll likely clear up the emissions code.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>5. Noises<\/h2>\n<p>In the worst of circumstances, you may hear some knocking or pinging sounds. &nbsp;This would indicate a misfire. However, not every engine relies so heavily on its knock sensor to cause a misfire.<\/p>\n<p>If you get misfire-related and knock sensor codes, you&#8217;re going to want to address the bad knock sensor first, as that will more than likely take care of the misfire issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If the check engine light is flashing, that means big trouble (keeping the engine running could potentially damage the catalytic converter).<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>A bad knock sensor will not usually be a breakdown risk. &nbsp;But, you should take care of it right away. &nbsp;Replacing it isn&#8217;t usually too difficult.<\/p>\n<p>Replacing the knock sensor will usually clear the code up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Modern vehicles use knock sensors to detect engine detonation. &nbsp;This allows the PCM (powertrain control module) to run very aggressive spark timing. &nbsp; Once the knock sensor has determined there is detonation, the timing is reduced, and the detonation will stop. &nbsp; If a knock sensor is bad, the PCM can&#8217;t make this important adjustment. &#8230; <a title=\"Bad Knock Sensor Symptoms\" class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/bad-knock-sensor-symptoms\/\" aria-label=\"More on Bad Knock Sensor Symptoms\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[17],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/202529"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=202529"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/202529\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=202529"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=202529"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=202529"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
