When it sticks, it won&#8217;t allow any coolant to pass through, and the engine will overheat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Failed Radiator Cap<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The radiator cap keeps pressure in the cooling system at optimal levels. If it malfunctions, it will cause the coolant to boil and the engine to overheat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Failed Water Pump<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Water-Pump-Used.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Water-Pump-Used.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-178733\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Water-Pump-Used.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Water-Pump-Used-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The water pump cycles coolant through the engine block, keeping it at a constant temperature. If the water pump fails, the engine won&#8217;t be able to maintain a steady temperature and will overheat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A failing water pump can cause your Nissan to overheat and code P1217 to appear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could be leaking, clogged, or have a mechanical issue that prevents it from working properly. If the water pump is to blame, it will need replacing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Leaking or Blocked Coolant Hoses<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Coolant hoses carry coolant to and from the radiator. If the hoses leak, or are blocked, there won&#8217;t be enough coolant in the system for proper cooling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Electric Cooling Fan Failure<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Engine-Cooling-Fan.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"323\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Engine-Cooling-Fan.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-178727\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Engine-Cooling-Fan.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Engine-Cooling-Fan-300x194.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The electric fan helps the engine regulate its temperature. If it fails, the engine won&#8217;t be able to cool itself properly and will overheat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fan relay sends power to the electric fan. If it fails, the fan won&#8217;t be able to turn on and the engine will overheat. There could also be a short circuit in the fan&#8217;s wiring harness. Inspect the harness for any signs of damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t touch the fan even if it&#8217;s off. It can turn on even with the engine off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Clogged Radiator<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The radiator can become clogged with dirt and debris. This prevents coolant from passing through, resulting in an overheating engine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Leaking Radiator<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/radiator-cap.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/radiator-cap.jpg\" alt=\"Leaking Radiator P1217 Cause\" class=\"wp-image-177817\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/radiator-cap.jpg 500w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/radiator-cap-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The radiator can also develop a leak. This will cause coolant to leak and the engine to overheat. The good news is that it&#8217;s an obvious problem. Look under your Nissan and check for any signs of leaking coolant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The engine coolant temperature sensor (ECT) monitors the temperature of the engine. If it fails, it won&#8217;t be able to accurately gauge how hot the engine is and P1217 will appear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check all wiring and connectors connected to the ECT for any damage or corrosion.&nbsp; The sensor itself could also need replacing if there are no physical problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have codes P0017 or P0018, start with the ECT.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Diagnosis\">Diagnosing P1217<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg\" alt=\"P1217 Diagnosis Nissan\" class=\"wp-image-190153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mlabs.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Auto-Diagnosis-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Does the electric fan kick on when your Nissan gets hot? The fan relay or wiring harness could be to blame if it doesn&#8217;t. Check for any signs of damage and replace if needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the electric fan works, inspect the cooling system for apparent issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by looking at the radiator and its hoses. With the engine off, squeeze the upper hose. Do you feel any pressure? Do you hear a squishing sound where the air is entering the system? Does the radiator look damaged?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does the water pump make a squeaking sound? If so, that&#8217;s a strong indication that it needs replacing. How is the belt that turns the water pump? Is it slipping? It&#8217;ll likely be cracked and glazed if it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nissan P1217 Code indicates that the engine is over temperature. The most common causes of this code are a stuck thermostat, failed radiator cap, or a faulty water pump. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to inspect all aspects of the cooling system and replace anything that needs replacing. Doing so will prevent further damage and keep your vehicle running at its best.
