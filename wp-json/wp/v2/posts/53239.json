That&#8217;s due to the relatively short list of issues that would cause it, and the relative accessibility of the EGR valve in most situations.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the most common causes of P0404:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>EGR Valve<\/h3>\n<p>It is very likely that the EGR valve itself is the cause of P0404. It may be stuck open or shut. The EGR&#8217;s job is to recirculate a certain amount of exhaust gas back into the combustion chamber. <\/p>\n<p>When it fails to recirculate this gas it can raise the combustion chamber temperature.

It&#8217;s also good to visually inspect the <strong>wiring harness plug<\/strong> at the EGR itself. If it is damaged, repairing it should solve the problem.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aa1car.com\/library\/tselec.htm\">How to Diagnose Electrical Problems in a Car<\/a> (aa1car.com)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>There can be other things that cause P0404 other than wiring and the EGR valve itself.
