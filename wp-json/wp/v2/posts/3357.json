They are presented somewhat in order from most to least likely to be causing the code:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bad Spark Plugs<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0Spark plugs are one of the most common causes of P0301. \u00a0Take a look at the electrodes and see if they are in good shape. \u00a0Most vehicles now come with iridium plugs that need changed very infrequently. \u00a0That being said, the plugs are a great place to start. \u00a0Here&#8217;s a great video on how to see if a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=61wdp9EjgGE\">spark plug is bad.<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Spark Plug Wires<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0On most modern engines, the plug wires are not nearly as long as they once were, but they can still go bad. \u00a0Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=12t_5ngXaTQ\">how to tell if your plug wires are bad<\/a> (video).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Coil Packs<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0Coil packs rarely go bad, but when they do, they can certainly cause P0301 in your Chevy Avalanche. \u00a0Replacing a set of packs can be very expensive. \u00a0Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebay.com\/gds\/How-to-Test-a-Coil-Pack-\/10000000205702258\/g.html\">how to test them<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bad Fuel Injector<\/strong>&#8211; \u00a0If you have a fuel injector that has gone bad, it won&#8217;t be able to properly atomize the fuel and you&#8217;ll get the P0301. \u00a0Here&#8217;s a good video on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tA_E6X4ISgQ\">how to diagnose an injector<\/a>, but it can be a little tricky. \u00a0This is definitely not the place to start.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Vacuum leak<\/strong>&#8211; If your Avalanche has a vacuum leak, it can be very difficult for it to get the right air\/fuel mixture. This will cause the cylinders to misfire and it&#8217;ll throw the P0301 if the leak is around that specific cylinder on the intake manifold. \u00a0It&#8217;s easy (and kind of fun) to chase one down. <em>Popular Mechanics<\/em>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.popularmechanics.com\/cars\/how-to\/a3094\/how-to-find-a-vacuum-leak\/\">How to find a vacuum leak<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cam or Crank Sensors<\/strong>&#8211; This one is very unlikely, but it does happen. If the ECU is not getting the right signal from these sensors, the vehicles timing is not going to sync up and it&#8217;ll misfire.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Low Compression<\/strong>&#8211; If you have a leaking head gasket, bent valve, cracked head, etc.. that would cause compression to not be as high as it should, you&#8217;re going to get P0301. You should also feel the vehicle is down on power as well. \u00a0You can usually borrow a compression tester from Autozone with a deposit via their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autozone.com\/landing\/page.jsp?name=loan-a-tool\">loan-a-tool program<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Most Common P0301 Fixes<\/h2>\n<p>If you follow the items listed above you should be able to fix the P0301. \u00a0Here&#8217;s how to go about it:<\/p>\n<p>Inspect and test the parts of the ignition system around cylinder 1 to determine whether or not you need to replace the coil packs, plugs, or wires. \u00a0Most of the time that&#8217;ll be it. \u00a0You can always reset the trouble codes and swap the coil pack, wire, and plug from cylinder 1 to another.<\/p>\n<p>If you get a different P030X code, you&#8217;l know that one of those three components is bad. \u00a0Go ahead and replace them or have them tested. \u00a0It&#8217;s an easy, and cheap method of determining if your ignition components have gone bad.<\/p>\n<p>After that you would want to test the fuel injection system. \u00a0There are links above that&#8217;ll show you how to do that. \u00a0If that doesn&#8217;t work, it may be time to do a compression test and see if you have a leak in that cylinder.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>Is P0301 a Serious Concern?<\/h2>\n<p>P0301 is cause for concern and left unfixed can get worse. Fixing the problem causing the code to fire can save you time and money and keep your Chevy from breaking down. \u00a0Quick action may also save your catalytic converter from ruin.<\/p>\n<p>Good luck diagnosing P0301 in your Chevy Avalanche!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>P0301 is a very common OBDII code that occurs in the\u00a0Chevy Avalanche.
