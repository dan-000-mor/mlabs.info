					<description><![CDATA[My 2007 H3 acted like the charging system wasn&#039;t working. had it tested at a Advanced Auto Parts. Said it was the alternator because the voltage regulator read high, 15.43 vdc. battery checked good, starter good, full load dropped 0.3 vdc to 15.13 vdc. replaced the alternator, 1 week later the battery was too low to start! Charged the battery and returned to AAP, ran alternator diagnostic same values within .2 vdc. this tech says its fine. i measure voltage with my DVM while car running at battery terminals... 15+ volts. what am I missing?]]></description>
